## Lists

* [Music Stores](/music-stores) - I've shopped at lots of music stores over the years, and it's always been one of my favorite things to do. Here's a list of my favorite shops.
* [Best Ever](/music-best-ever) - I've kept lists of my favorite music seemingly forever, here I break it out by listing all of my favorites.
* [Best By year](/music-best-by-year) - Same as above, but my yearly lists.
* [Concerts](/music-concerts) - I still love going to concerts, here's my list of current and upcoming shows, as well as some of the more recent years listing the conerts I've attended.
* [Ticketstubs](https://github.com/philcryer/wwebsites/tree/master/ticketstubs.philcryer.com/galleries)
Years ago I made an effort to scan all of the ticketstubs I've had from concerts, going back to the 80s. While these are not in gallery form right now, I wanted them to be out there, so for now they're linked to in github.
