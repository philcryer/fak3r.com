## Lists

I've kept lists of my favorite music seeminly forever, here I break it out by listing all of my favorites, and more recently, year by year.

* [Ever](/music-best-ever)
* [By year](/music-best-by-year)

## Concerts

I still love going to concerts, here's some of the more recent years listing the conerts I've attended.

* [By year](/music-concerts)

## Ticketstubs

Years ago I made an effort to scan all of the ticketstubs I've had from concerts, going back to the 80s. While these are not in gallery form right now, I wanted them to be out there, so for now they're linked to in github.
