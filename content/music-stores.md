I've been visiting, and buying music at record shops since the late 1970s. I still have some records my Pops bought me back when we'd go to [Streetside Records](https://www.bbb.org/us/mo/saint-louis/profile/music-store/streetside-records-0734-110170575) RIP, which was located at 742 N Ballas Road, Saint Louis, MO 63141. Since then I've been going to as many shops as I can, and locally (in Saint Louis) we have many good ones, but of course there are some amazing ones I've hit over the years. I wanted to start a list of shops I like so that I have something to refer to when I'm looking for somehting I can't find locally, and want to find it out there to order it from. I'll list shops that I've ordered from, but haven't visited (yet) as well.
