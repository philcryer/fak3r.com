As always, this was a big music year for me, while attending less live shows I think I've bought and listened to more music to (sort of) make up for it. I'm also enjoying the home stereo even more now with my early 70s [McIntosh MA-6100](http://www.roger-russell.com/amppre.htm) pre-amp/amp, and now even some respectable headphones for work, the [Grado SR60i](http://www.gradolabs.com/frameset_main.htm). This year bands **introduced via Twitter** from other music freaks have greatly helped diversify my palate. I can highly recommend the following for this: [@captainsdead](http://twitter.com/captainsdead), [@truersound](http://twitter.com/Truersound) and [@somevelvetblog](http://twitter.com/somevelvetblog). (if have other suggestions, leave them in the comments!) So here are the releases that I spent the most time with in 2010, each with a track from each release for you to hear/sample. Leave me feedback as to how my tastes compare to yours, as well as anything I may have missed. Finally, as always with music, see the bands when you can and **buy locally, buy often**.

1-2-3-4...GO!
