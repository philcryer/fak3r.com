Another year almost in the books, and music continues to be a huge part of my psyche. This year [I hit more concerts](https://fak3r.com/music-concerts/) than I had since I moved from Austin, so that was a significant factor in getting through the year. As always besides discovering and listening to music, I love sharing, and talking about what I like with others, which just fuels more discovery and passion. This yearly list is another signpost in that journey. Also, I made a decent attempt to link to most of the music I picked, so follow the links you're interested and let me know what you like.

## The top 12

I dislike ranking my favorite music of they year since there are so many different aspects that appeal to me, it just doesn't seem fair. Regardless I have to have a 'tops' list, and here it is for 2019.

* Black Belt Eagle Scout ["At the Party with My Brown Friends"](https://blackbelteaglescout.bandcamp.com/album/at-the-party-with-my-brown-friends) - Spotify was a huge help in discovering new artists and bands this year, and Black Belt Eagle Scout was an early find. Her reissued debut was fantastic, and I saw her open for Julia Jacklin in Kansas City, and was amazed at her presence, dedication and guitar playing. Later in the year she released this one, and I saw her as she headlined late in the year, and her and her band were just more polished and strong. Love the new songs, love her singing, guitar, songwriting, just a great artist with a lot to say.
* Nick Cave And The Bad Seeds ["Ghosteen"](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Ghosteen+%E2%80%93+Nick+Cave+and+The+Bad+Seeds) - Speaking of an artist with a lot to say, Nick Cave released this double album of mainly quieter songs all dealing with loss, sorrow and hope for the future. While this is a heavy Warren Ellis ambient sounding album, you only need look at what Cave and Ellis have been doing for motion picture soundtracks, and even a large part of the last album "Skeleton Tree". While some reviews bemoan this lack of banging, it reminds me of Thurston Moore talking about a review with a kid complaining their recent release was lame because "They didn't bust out once". I feel as an artist, Nick Cave can create whatever he pleases, and we should be fortunate to bear witness to his art. Yes, this album won't get confused with any Birthday Party or even early Bad Seeds, this is heavy, great stuff from a master. I expect this to grow on me even more than "Tree" or "Push The Sky Away". 
* Craig Finn ["I Need a New War"](https://craigfinn.bandcamp.com/album/i-need-a-new-war) - Craig Finn is the lead singer of The Hold Steady, but as a prolific songwriter, he's long needed to step out and release his own material. "I Need A New War" is the 3rd in his trilogy that began in 2015 with "Faith In The Future", followed by 2017’s "We All Want The Same Things". Craig is a master storyteller about characters in his songs more than anyone I've ever heard. His songs are about real people (even if they're not), with real issues that everyone can relate to. His soft-spoken delivery doesn't always resemble singing, but the emotion, and detail of his characters lives always comes through loud and clear. While I liked the other 2 albums, I really love this one, and was lucky enough to talk to him after a set this year. As you'd expect he's a laid back, appreciative person, and didn't seem to want to stop talking about his work.

* Julia Jacklin ["Crushing"](https://juliajacklin.bandcamp.com/album/crushing) - I don't remember when I first heard Julia Jacklin, but I remember when her album "Crushing" really hit. I was on an overnight bus trip to Orlando, and her soothing vocals just went perfectly with the blurry background speeding by. Julia is a singer-songwriter from Australia, and "Crushing" is her 2nd effort, but she seems far more seasoned than that. For a long time this Spring and Summer this was my most listened to album, and I really love it.
* Pile ["Green and Gray"](https://pile.bandcamp.com/album/green-and-gray) - Pile is a heavier band, originally from Boston, they now reside in Nashville, which gives me hope for more shows in my area. When I first read about them they were described as your favorite band's favorite band. I can see that, and a Spotify playlist of their best work guided me along the first 6 albums, until I was ready for "Green And Gray" this year. With vocals and stories that often seem to broach the 'emo' tag, there's no mistaking that Pile really doesn't sound like any other band I can think of. Their use of melodics and the odd time signatures make me think of old math-rock bands like aMinture, but with a clearly rawer vibe. This is a band I've never seen live, but are high on the list of ones I need to see in 2020. To me, these are songs to change your life to, they're powerful and speak to me.
* PUP ["Morbid Stuff"](https://puptheband.bandcamp.com/album/morbid-stuff) - I first heard PUP years ago, and still think "The Dream Is Over" is one of the best introductory albums to a band I can think of, but this year's effort "Morbid Stuff" really shows the polish and a nice continuation of their craft. They clearly love what they're doing and haven't taken the easy road, but you can tell they appreciate the adoration of their fans. Seeing them live this year was a highlight, as the crown goes bananas, screaming along to the lyrics as if they were at a Guided by Voices, or Hold Steady show. Really, it's that kind of connection... of course throw in some pop-punkier elements and you have plenty of time to spread out and build your own mosh pit while you're there, an energetic blast of fun!

* Purple Mountains ["Purple Mountains"](https://purplemountains.bandcamp.com/album/purple-mountains)
* Refused ["War Music"](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=refused+%22war+music%22) - I discovered Refused in 1997, when they released their classic "The Shape Of Punk To Come" and then broke up during the ensuing tour. While it kind of reminds me of another band I feel for in 1987, just as they were breaking up (The Smiths), this one has a happier ending. Refused reformed after years of Dennis and crew rocking in other outfits and started putting out new records. 
* Justin Townes Earle ["The Saint of Lost Causes"](https://justintownesearle.bandcamp.com/album/the-saint-of-lost-causes)
