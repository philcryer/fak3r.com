![Jose Antonio Ortiz](http://www.fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/jose-antonio-ortiz.jpg)I'm all for having opinions, but if a simple disagreement turns to violence, someone must be watching too much tv.  The apparent argument was over a [Hillary Clinton-Barack Obama argument](http://www.celebratty.net/hillary-clinton-supporter-stabs-brother-in-law)! "_...Jose Antonio Ortiz, a Clinton supporter, allegedly stabbed his brother-in-law Sean Shurelds in the stomach after they argued over the race for nomination. Shurelds, 41, an Obama supporter, told Ortiz his candidate was “trashing” Clinton, in reference to a string of recent victories by the Illinois senator in preliminary voting in various states. According to the police report, Ortiz replied that “Obama was not a realist” before the argument, in the kitchen of a Pennsylvania home, turned physical. After some mutual choking and punching, the 28-year-old allegedly stabbed Shurelds in the stomach. He has been charged with aggravated assault, among other charges, while Shurelds was flown to a nearby hospital, where he was admitted in critical condition._"  Uggg...so I assume Jose will be voting by 'absentee' ballot this year.
