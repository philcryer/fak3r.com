I'm running [Graphene OS](https://grapheneos.org/), the "private and secure mobile operating system with Android app compatibility. Developed as a non-profit open source project", on my new [Google Pixel 8a](https://store.google.com/product/pixel_8a)), and it's going great. Not only does this address many long term concerns about online privacy *and* security, but it allows me full control over how exposed I am to online marketing, and more nefarious things.

(content coming soon)

## Setup

## Post processing

## Support

### Does everything just work?

I've had some hickups, but figured out how to get all apps working so far except for Southwest Airlines app. I freezes on the splashscreen - how can I debug what's going on or get an idea if it's failing because it needs permissions or something?
