Andrew Bird's new release, _Armchair Apocrypha, _doesn't come out until March 20th, but I'm already expecting it to be killer, simply because his last, _The Mysterious Production Of Eggs_, continues to amaze me.  He's [touring pretty extensively](http://www.andrewbird.tickets.musictoday.com/AndrewBird/calendar.aspx) for this one, coming back to St. Louis in March.  Seeing him recreate the songs live with just him and a drummer is something else and his last appearance was a really good show, but I was hoping for a more intimate room than The Paegant for this go around, but no.   Perhaps getting there early to sit up front would help.  Here's a single from the upcoming relase.
