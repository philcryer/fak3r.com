It's another year where music led me to unexpected places. I enjoyed finding out about new bands/sounds via the internet, as always, but even more so in person, thanks to amazing music festivals like [Gonerfest](https://goner-records.com/pages/gonerfest) in Memphis, which I finally got to attend (just needed someone cool enough to see new bands with me!) and [T1Fest](https://t1fest.com/) in Chicago, while I've been 100s of times before, it was my 2nd favorite city I visited this year. I need to add more thoughts and images to this post, but for now...

## The best

* ANOHNI and the Johnsons "My Back Was a Bridge for You to Cross"
* Bass Drum of Death "Say I Won't" - saw them live this year
* CIVIC "Taken By Force" - saw them live at Gonerfest 20
* Indigo De Souza "All of This Will End"
* Do Nothing "Snake Sideways"
* Electric Chair "Act Of Agression"
* Four Tet "Live at Alexandra Palace London, 24th May 2023"
* Fruit Bats "A River Running to Your Heart"
* The Hold Steady "The Price of Progress" - saw them live (again) in Chicago at the new/caverous Salt Shed
* Hotline TNT "Cartwheel"
* MJ Lenderman "And The Wind (Live And Loose!)" - saw him play guitar with Wednesday
* Mandy, Indiana "I’ve Seen a Way"
* North Americans "Long Cool World"
* Ryuichi Sakamoto "12" - RIP, an amazing artist
* Sleaford Mods "UK GRIM"
* Slowdive "everything is alive" - will see them live this year
* Swans "The Beggar" - will see them live this year
* Sweeping Promises "Good Living is Coming For You" - saw them live 2x, once at favorite Off Broadway and then again at Gonerfest 20
* Unknown Mortal Orchestra "V"
* Víkingur Ólafsson Bach "Goldberg Variations" - new classical pianist from Iceland that I'm obsessed with
* Wednesday "Rat Saw God" - saw them earlier this year
* Yard Act  "Where’s My Utopia?"
* Yo La Tengo "This Stupid World" - after so many years they can still put out killer albums

## Honerable mentions

Nothing wrong with these releases, they either didn't hit me the same as the ones above, or they haven't hit me yet. 

* Black Belt Eagle Scout "The Land, the Water, the Sky"
* Black Country, New Road "Live at Bush Hall"
* Black Thought & Leon Michels "Glorious Game"
* Blur "The Ballad of Darren"
* Daughter "Stereo Mind Game"
* Iris DeMent "Workin' on a World"
* En Attendant Ana "Principia (Trouble in Mind)"
* Fucked Up "One Day"
* Gorillaz "Cracker Island"
* PJ Harvey "I Inside the Old Year Dying"
* Ibex Clone "All Channels Clear" - saw them live at Gonerfest 20
* Lydia Loveless "Nothing’s Gonna Stand In My Way Again" - maybe unfair but I'm not sure she'll ever top "Somewhere Else" (Bloodshot, 2014)
* Lucero "Should’ve Learned by Now"
* The Murder Capital "Gigi's Recovery"
* Pile "All Fiction"
* Quasi "Breaking the Balls of History" - saw them live this year and it was such a fun show, Janet is still a hero of mine, Sleater-Kinney will never be the same
* shame "Food For Worms"
* U.S. Girls "Bless This Mess"
* Youth Lagoon "Heaven is a Junkyard" - slept on this one, still don't regret missing him live... but think this album is special

This year life has taught me to never say never, and gave me my current motto; don't look back. Dig in!
