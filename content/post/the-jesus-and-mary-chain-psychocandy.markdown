I recently *re-bought* [The Jesus and Mary Chain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jesus_and_Mary_Chain) "[Psychocandy](http://www.rhino.com/store/ProductDetail.lasso?Number=73379)" on the reissue DualDisc...and what a nice package. The stock album is a great upgrade in fidelity (props to them for NOT adding bonus tracks to the original recording - even going so far as taking out the 'bonus track' that appeared on the 1980s era tape!) and the second side boasts the DVD-Audio version of the album, as well as all of the videos from that release. Seems all of their releases have been have been remastered this way, and as always with anything Rhino does, it's done top notch. Originally released in November of 1985, _"Psychocandy"_ was the Mary Chain's debut album and featured the singles 'You Trip Me Up' and 'Just Like Honey', which played over the ending of the movie 'Lost In Translation' from 2004. Psychocandy is just such a classic, filtering through the brashy/harshness of Velvet Underground inspired feedback while defining the shoegazer genre. I must have originally bought this in 1998/9, but pulled it out recently after listening to a boot from '86. I love things that stand up over time, and this is a perfect example of that.
