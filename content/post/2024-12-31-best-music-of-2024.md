* Caribou "Honey"
* Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds "Wild God" - going to see the master again in a few months, this is a great album
* The Cure "Songs Of A Lost World" - no idea how he does it, this brings me back to Disintegration, which is a great thing
* Floating Witch's Head "Fuzzy Details" - brilliant openers for Built to Spill, with a Philip Glass movie (Koyaanisqatsi) projected behind them. A nod to the Velvets?
* Four Tet "Three"
* IDLES "TANGK" - maybe my other favorite live set of the year, they constantly bring it. H/T to English Teacher (see below) for a great opening set
