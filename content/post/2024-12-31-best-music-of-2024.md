Here's some of my favorite releases from 2024, remember, don't look back. Dig in!

* Acetone "I've Enjoyed As Much Of This As I Can Stand" - this live document of Acetone served as a fine topper to the amazing [New West box set](https://newwestrecords.com/collections/acetone) of their discography, as well as being great reminder to all their fans what made them so special. A special band
* Bad Nerves "Still Nervous"
* [Better Lovers](https://betterloversband.com/) "Highly irresponsible" - maybe my favorite live set from the year, and I saw them twice, talked to Greg (singer) after a show and he is just a dynamo, from his pedigree to his showmanship - this is what hardcore/metalcore has been missing imo

* Caribou "Honey"
* Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds "Wild God" - going to see the master again in a few months, this is a great album
* The Cure "Songs Of A Lost World" - no idea how he does it, this brings me back to Disintegration, which is a great thing
* Floating Witch's Head "Fuzzy Details" - brilliant openers for Built to Spill, with a Philip Glass movie (Koyaanisqatsi) projected behind them. A nod to the Velvets?
* Four Tet "Three"
* IDLES "TANGK" - maybe my other favorite live set of the year, they constantly bring it. H/T to English Teacher (see below) for a great opening set

* Les Savy Fav "OUI,LSF"
* The Messthetics "[The Messthetics and James Brandon Lewis](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1214633140_10.jpg)" - featuring Joe and Brendan, better known as the rhythm section of [Fugazi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugazi)
* Modern Life Is War "Tribulation Workshops" - it's an EP but it's what I listened to most this year. Fantastic record, and I just missed seeing them as they cancelled their show here. Next time 
* Osees "SORCS 80" - back to their more garagy/punk sound, I approve
* [Personal Trainer](https://personaltrainer.bandcamp.com/) "[Still Willing](https://personaltrainer.bandcamp.com/album/still-willing)" - from The Netherlands, I saw them in Copenhagen at a small Christiana concert venue, which I now love

* Jeff Parker ETA IVtet "The Way Out of Easy" - more great jazz, this time off the court
* Shellac "To All Trains" [RIP Steve Albini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Albini) - they'll never be anyone like him. What a huge impact he had on music that I love, from PJ to Weddos and beyond, not to mention Shellac, who I was lucky to see a few times.
* The Smile "Wall of Eyes"
* [Soup Activists](https://soupactivists.bandcamp.com/) "[Mummy What are Flowers For?](https://soupactivists.bandcamp.com/album/mummy-what-are-flowers-for)" - a Saint Louis band that floored me when they opened for [Sweeping Promises](https://sweepingpromises.com/) last year, then they actually recorded this in Kansas with Sweeping Promises. Sharp stuff this
