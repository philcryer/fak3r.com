![cell phone](http://cryer.us/fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/cellphone.jpg)As far as cell phones, [this is what I’ve been saying all along](http://reports.discoverychannel.ca/servlet/an/discovery/1/20060529/discovery_cell_simple_060529/20060529?hub=DiscoveryReport); make simple phones that are easy to use, drop the idea of making some all-in-one camera, instantmessanger, emailchecker, websurfer, gamesystem and just give me a phone to call home with.  ”_Most cell phone customers don’t use the camera, email, or gaming options offered by their wireless providers.
