Since the health-care debate brought out the worst in the tea party protesters, we've seen a shift from fear mongering, to the disgusting behavior of last weekend that included bigoted, racist name calling, spitting on on elected officials and finally vandalism and death threats.  If it weren't clear before, the 'movement' has truly showed us what is  behind their manufactured anger, and it ain't health care.  Case in point, how can people be mad now, when they weren't mad when the previous administration that just walked all over the constitution, sent us into a war with a country that never attacked us and raised the debt to record highs?  Well as I tried to figure out how to condense my thoughts, who would have thought Rosie O'Donnell would have covered it so well, with a post on her blog titled [We had eight years of Bush and Cheney, Now you get mad!?](http://www.rosie.com/blog/2010/03/28/sent-to-me-today---pass-it-on/) One of her readers was able to succinctly break down the blatant hypocrisy of this whole affair, providing a perfect platform for a tea party rebuttal, but don't expect that, instead lets expect more gay bashing from those cowards.  I'm reprinting the post here (just like the [DailyKos did](http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2010/3/28/851912/-We-had-eight-years-of-Bush-and-Cheney,-Now-you-get-mad!)) because it needs more exposure, so please pass it on.  After that, follow-up by reading Frank Rich's Op-Ed titled [The Rage Is Not About Health Care](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/28/opinion/28rich.html) for more rational of what is the true driver for this behavior, it gives us a lot to think about.

You finally got mad when the government decided that people in America deserved the right to see a doctor if they are sick.  Yes, illegal wars, lies, corruption, torture, stealing your tax dollars to make the rich richer, are all okay with you, but helping other Americans...oh hell no.
