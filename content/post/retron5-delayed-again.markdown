<p>So while it's not a secret, no one I talk to ever knows what the <a href="http://hyperkin.com">Hyperkin Retron 5</a> is, or why its release has been so anticipated by old school gamers like me. Basically, Hyperkin has released other "Retron" models that play the old 8-bit Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and the Super Nintendo Entertainment system, with varying degrees of success, but with their latest release, Retron 5, they promise compatibility with *ten* classic gaming system cartridges: NES, Famicom, Super NES and Famicom, Sega Master System, Genesis and Mega Drive, and Game Boy original, Color and Advance. The rumored price is $99 USD, but even if it is twice that it will be a steal, since I've toyed with the idea of buying an old NES and SNES before. I read that the system may be running Android, but what I do know is that you can use all of the original controllers, which is a huge plus, and can do things like save the games.</p>

<p>So, unfortunately the release date, December 10, 2013, has been pushed back again, but this time it's an actual physical issue with the unit, "<i>Hyperkin has delayed the RetroN 5 release due to faulty pins discovered in some packaged units</i>", which tells us that production has occurred! Now it's slated for Q1 of 2014, and this time they have better chance of hitting it. Check out <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/09/19/hyperkin-retron-5-game-console-on-sale-december-10/">Engadget</a> for more details on the system, until then I'll be clearing space and watching eBay auctions for old games and controllers!</p>
