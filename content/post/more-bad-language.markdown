We're big on phone meetings at the big company I work for; I guess when there's over 10,000 folks in the company they think it's a good idea.  Anyway I had some more bizspeak spouted out yesterday on a call that just made my jaw drop.  The speaker used the phrase _tribal knowledge_ while referring to our groups' ability to administrate.  WTF?  I have never heard that one, and wished we were in a face to face meeting so I could see if any others had the same look on their face as I did when I heard that one...and it was used AT LEAST FOUR TIMES!  Of course the standard _let's take this offline_ was probably used more than 10 times; while it's an oldie it's popularity is still on the rise.  It makes me want to have a conversation with Lawrence, you know, the neighbor from [Office Space](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0151804/maindetails).  Peter: _Let me ask you something. When you come in on Monday, and you're not feelin' real well, does anyone ever say to you, '[Sounds like someone has a case of the Mondays](http://reelwavs.com/movies/office_space/)'?_  

Lawrence: _No. No, man. Shit, no, man. I believe you'd get your ass kicked sayin' something like that, man._  That movie was just a snapshot of so many peoples' lives that I know (as well as my own).  Cool that it's finally been [re-released on DVD](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AP04L0/qid=1133455180/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/104-8281868-3820748?s=dvd&v=glance&n=130), now with flair and just in time for the hoildays.
