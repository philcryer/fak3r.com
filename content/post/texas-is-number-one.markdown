![Don’t Mess With Texas](http://www.fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/texas-state-flag_small.jpg)As everyone knows, Texans like to brag, so being number one seems like a great place for anything Texas; [save for this](http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1704336,00.html).  "_Texans' fondness for large, manly vehicles has helped make the Lone Star State the biggest carbon polluter in the nation. The headquarters state of America's oil industry spewed **670 million metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in 2003, enough that Texas would rank seventh in the world if it were its own country**, according to the most recent figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. **The amount is more than that of California and Pennsylvania — the second- and third-ranking states — combined**. A multitude of factors contribute to the carbon output, among them: Texas' 19 coal-burning power plants; a heavy concentration of refineries and chemical plants; a lack of mass transit; and a penchant among ranchers and urban cowboys alike for brawny, gas-guzzling trucks — sometimes to haul things, but often just to look Texas tough._"  Obviously living in Austin I didn't see as much of this, but when we'd visit Houston you could see the facts to support the above claims; it was a mess.
