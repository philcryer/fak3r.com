I've been listening to [Explosions in the Sky](http://www.explosionsinthesky.com/) like crazy recently.  I really love the new cd, and shows of theirs are available in a few places online.  You can grab one from the current tour on npr.org, as part of their 'NPR Live Concert Series'.  It's easy to download, as they have it packed as one 66Meg mp3 (hey, IMO concerts don't have a forward or back buttons to skip songs, so why should this?) Read the article [here](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9146453), and then scroll down about half way and click on the link that says _>>   Download Explosions in the Sky_ to download the show.  It's a great introduction to the band, props to [npr ](http://www.npr.org)for posting this, and props to EITS for allowing it to be shared.
