<div align="right"><img src="/2007/table.jpg">Mike Jones, the former prostitute who Ted Haggard visited, has the <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&sspagename=ADME%3AB%3AAAQ%3AUS%3A1&viewitem=&item=290092184603&rd=1">offical massage table on eBay</a>! It’s currently at 1175$ with 6 days to go, and with
____"All proceeds benefit ‘Project Angel Heart’, who provides people living with HIV/AIDS, cancer and other life-threatening illnesses nutritious home-delivered meals"_ it’s for the right reasons. I took the opportunity to send him a note myself, _“Mike - Don’t think your bravery wasn’t noticed, thanks for doing what you did, and what you’re doing now. We live in a free country, but when someone who judges others (especially when that person welds so much power) they need to be held accountable for their own actions. Thanks”_ Regardless of your values and/or religious beliefs, I hope you feel the same about abuse of power and hypocrisy.</div>

**UPDATE**: I heard back from Mike almost immeidately, _"Thank you for your kind words of support.  It means a lot to me.  The best to you.  Mike Jones"_ That makes me feel good, hopefully one day we'll be able to [treat everyone equally](http://hrc.org/) and not judge others.
