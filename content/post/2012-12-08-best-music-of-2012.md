![Tame Impala rocking it in New York (photo from Pitchforkmedia)](https://cdn3.pitchfork.com/news/47431/f25e0a8f.jpg)Another year of fun discovering new toons, what's not to like? This year took on a more guitar friendly indie sound than past years, a trend I fully support. While there are some comebacks there are more than a few new entries, which again, is that discovery that keeps me going. If I had to pick one disk that I listened to most it'd probably be Swearin', the fine outfit from Brooklyn that I got to see open for the Japandroids this year; what a fun, unexpected bunch of songs. Meanwhile Tame Impala came back with a monster of a sophomore release, proving Innerspeaker was no fluke. Special notice to Future Of The Left, with a record that makes me think back to early Brainiac, which is always a good thing. With that, here are my picks for the best music of 2012.<!-- more -->
