Want to learn elements that will appear in the upcoming HTML 5?  Yeah, I didn't think so either, but it's actually really cool.  [New Elements in HTML 5](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/x-html5/?ca=dgr-lnxw01NewHTML) shows you how to use new tags like header, section, article, footer, menu, and such, show that you won't have to define DIV's all day, and laying out a page will be a snap, it's much more CSS friendly.  I wonder how long it'll take to actually implement and be supported by the majority of browsers?  I know when it comes out I'll make a 5 version of my sites to show, if ppl hit them with 5 able browsers.
