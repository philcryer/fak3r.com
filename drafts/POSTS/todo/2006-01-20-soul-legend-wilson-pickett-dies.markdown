Another clasic soul legend gone; [Wilson Pickett dies at 64](http://www.guardian.co.uk/arts/news/story/0,,1691201,00.html).  ”_Wilson Pickett, the soul pioneer best known for hard-driving hits Mustang Sally and In The Midnight Hour, has died of a heart attack in Virginia, his management company said last night. He was 64, and had been in declining health for the past year. “We’ve lost a giant, we’ve lost a legend, we’ve lost a man who created his own charisma and made it work around the world,” soul singer Solomon Burke, a close friend of Pickett’s, told Reuters. “It’s just hard for me to really grasp that Wilson is already travelling towards the greater place_.”  




More details about his life and career from [ABC News](http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200601/s1551594.htm); ”_Dubbed ‘Wicked’ Wilson Pickett by Jerry Wexler, the co-founder of Atlantic Records, where he enjoyed his greatest success, Pickett was one of the leading exponents of the hard-edged Memphis sound, a grittier alternative to the pop singles being churned out by Motown Records in Detroit. Often recording with the house band of Memphis-based Stax Records, Booker T and the MGs, he enjoyed a long string of hits during the 1960s, including the R&B chart-toppers 634-5789, Land of 1,000 Dances and Funky Broadway. The song In the Midnight Hour was his breakthrough hit, transforming the relative unknown into a soul sensation virtually overnight in 1965.  Pickett co-wrote the tune with MGs guitarist Steve Cropper in about an hour, and it spent a week atop the R&B singles chart in August of that year_.”  So along with Burke, Booker T and the MGs, Otis Redding and James Brown, Pickett helped to define the hard driving R+B of the late 60’s.  Steve Cropper (his writing partner for in the Midnight Hour) was in Booker T’s band, and also appeared in the classic movie, [The Blues Brothers](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080455/).  I always like pointing out the amazing soul musicians from the 60s that were in that movie; they were the real deal.  As for Pickett, I’ll always remember his song Mustang Sally being covered at my wedding reception by local legends [The Soulard Blues Band](http://www.soulardbluesband.com/).
