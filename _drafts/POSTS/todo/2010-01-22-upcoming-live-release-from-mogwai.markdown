This year [Mogwai](http://www.mogwai.co.uk/) will release a live cd and album, _Special Moves_, and a dvd, _Burning_, covering a three night set during the 2009 shows in Brooklyn.  Here they are doing _Mogwai Fear Satan_, which while from the same tour, is not from the film, but is shot by the same people (thanks for the info Stuart, pictured above) so it's a good look into what to expect.  If it's all like this it looks like the perfect live film in my opinion, focused on the band interactions and movement, not the audience.  To find out more, and get a free mp3 download of _2 Rights Make 1 Wrong _from the set, visit [Special Moves](http://www.mogwaispecialmoves.com/).  Can't wait to see/hear this, after taking a long time to get into [_The Hawk Is Howling_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hawk_Is_Howling), I'm ready to see them live again.  I was still 'digesting' the re-release of _[Young Team](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mogwai_Young_Team)_ that I bought in London last year, but it's been a long time since I've seen them live as they haven't toured St. Louis, and the Austin gigs were too long ago to count.  Just can't wait for this release.<!-- more -->
