![tux.jpg](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/tux.jpg)While looking for something else, (which is mainly when I find *other* interesting things) I found an article which included links for four free Linux eBooks.  This is a great resource for anyone with some Linux experience, back to others who may be looking to get started with tux, and I would have loved to have this when I started, but that was before the Internet was available to most people.  So, if you're new to Linux, or want to get started (I used [Red Hat Unleashed](http://www.amazon.com/Red-Linux-Unleashed-Kamran-Husain/dp/0672309629) in 1996, here it is [online](http://wireless.ictp.it/school_2003/docs/linux/linux_guides/RH_Linux_Unleashed/)!), here's some great downloads to learn from:<!-- more -->


### Linux Starter Pack


_By [TuxRadar](http://tuxradar.com)_

Here’s your complete guide to using Linux, taking you from beginner level to an intermediate user with ease. This ebook will show you how to install Linux,  navigate around the desktop, use common software, add more programs and fix any problems you may encounter. It’s based around a slightly older version of Ubuntu Linux so there may be some minor differences with newer releases, but you can always download the latest version from www.ubuntu.com or get a CD sent by post at shipit.ubuntu.com.

### The Easiest Linux Guide You’ll Ever Read


_by Scott Morris_
After several months of writing and revising, Scott has made available the “Easiest Linux Guide You’ll Ever Read”. It is a 160-page book geared towards people who are competent with using Windows, who have never attempted to use Linux but are interested in giving it a try. This ebook seems to be around for quite some time, so I wouldn’t be surprised if a lot of you have already went through this copy.

### Ubuntu: Pocket Guide and Reference


**A concise companion for day-to-day Ubuntu use**
_by Keir Thomas_
A comprehensive, 170 page ebook which will get you started with Ubuntu. I believe a lot of computer users have intentions of getting a Linux system up just to test and experience the power behind this free operating system. There are various types of Linux, but so far, and at least for me, Ubuntu seems the most popular so far. I’m no means an experienced user of Ubuntu, so I can’t really speak on why it’s popular, but I think the simplicity, compatibility and user friendliness should do the trick. Some of the chapters in this ebook include:-



	
  * Introduction

	
  * Chapter One: Installing Ubuntu

	
  * Chapter Two: Configuring Ubuntu

	
  * Chapter Three: Getting to grips with the desktop

	
  * Chapter Four: Users and the filesystem

	
  * Chapter Five: Hands-on at the command-line

	
  * Chapter Six: Software management

	
  * Chapter Seven: Securing the system
