## Summary

### Background

<blockquote>
The Tor Project, Inc, became a 501(c)(3) nonprofit in 2006, but the idea of "onion routing" began in the mid 1990s.

Just like Tor users, the developers, researchers, and founders who've made Tor possible are a diverse group of people. But all of the people who have been involved in Tor are united by a common belief: internet users should have private access to an uncensored web.

In the 1990s, the lack of security on the internet and its ability to be used for tracking and surveillance was becoming clear, and in 1995, David Goldschlag, Mike Reed, and Paul Syverson at the U.S. Naval Research Lab (NRL) asked themselves if there was a way to create internet connections that don't reveal who is talking to whom, even to someone monitoring the network. Their answer was to create and deploy the first research designs and prototypes of onion routing.

The goal of onion routing was to have a way to use the internet with as much privacy as possible, and the idea was to route traffic through multiple servers and encrypt it each step of the way. This is still a simple explanation for how Tor works today. [Source](https://www.torproject.org/about/history/)

</blockquote>

With this, it's easy to understand why I used to run a [Tor Relay](https://community.torproject.org/relay/) from my personal servers, but it always took some time to setup/configure and maintain it. After watching a recent panel from The Tor Project, ["Distribute(d) Trust: The key to global encryption access"](https://www.youtube.com/live/r-wgsjyQlLs) I decided to spin one up again, but since today I use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for so many things, I looked for a way to utilize that. Well, they make it easy, so here's how to run a Tor Relay in Docker.

## Why

If you're not familar with Tor you may be wondering, why would I want to run a Tor Relay? EFF (the Electronic Frontier Foudation) has a great post about the benifits that [Tor Relays](https://www.eff.org/pages/what-tor-relay), as well as the Tor network, basically, "Tor is a service that helps you to protect your anonymity while using the Internet. Tor is comprised of two parts: software you can download that allows you to use the Internet anonymously, and the volunteer network of computers that makes it possible for that software to work." So to make the network stronger, we can run a Tor Relay, before you do you should understand what a [Tor Relay provides](https://blog.torproject.org/new-guide-running-tor-relay/), as well as the EFF's [Legal FAQ for Tor Relay Operators](https://www.eff.org/pages/legal-faq-tor-relay-operators). Essentially Tor can route traffic through your relay, technically an obfs4-bridge, but since it uses the source IP from the Tor Exit Node, not your bridge's IP, you won't get complaints from your upstream provider. Exit Nodes are very important but I don't recommend you run them at home, I've run Tor bridges off and on for many years from home and various [VPS Hosting](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-a-virtual-private-server) providers, and have never had a problem or complaint. As always IANAL and YMMV, so know your rights.

## Howto

### Install requirements

First we need to install the software required to run this

- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/), I recommend running it in [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux/), but it can be easily installed in [macOS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/) and [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)
- Install [Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Setup steps

Now we'll follow [Tor's official Docker steps](https://community.torproject.org/relay/setup/bridge/docker/), so open a Terminal in Linux or macOS, if you're in Windows I recommend the realtively new [Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9n0dx20hk701) from Microsoft and follow along

1. Create a directory to hold the Tor Relay Docker project, you could do it differently, but I create a path/directory like this

```shell
mkdir -p ~/Docker/obfs4-bridge
```

2. Change into that directory, or whatever path/directory you created

```shell
cd ~/Docker/obfs4-bridge
```

3. Download `docker-compose.yml` which tells Docker how to run the bridge, I'll use `curl`, but you could just [download the file](https://gitlab.torproject.org/torproject/anti-censorship/docker-obfs4-bridge/raw/main/docker-compose.yml) and place it in this directory

```shell
curl -OL https://gitlab.torproject.org/torproject/anti-censorship/docker-obfs4-bridge/raw/main/docker-compose.yml
```

### Configure

In order to define the variables need to run this we need a file in this dictory for the environmental variables we will use for this project, again I'll use curl but you could load this URL and save the file with a browser

```shell
curl -OL https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/docker-obfs4-bridge/-/raw/main/.env
```

Now we'll edit that file, adding the 3 variables needed to run this; the OR_PORT, the PT_PORT (the obfs4 port), and make sure that both ports are forwarded in your firewall to the host running the relay. If you don't know how to do this, search for port-forwardig or how to run NAT on your brand of router or wifi access point. Adding your email address, allows the Tor project or others to get in touch with you if there are problems with your Relay.

> ![NOTE]
> The ports are somewhat arbitray, but avoid port 9001 because it's commonly associated with Tor and censors may be scanning the Internet for this port

```shell
# Set required variables
# Your bridge's Tor port.
OR_PORT=9099
# Your bridge's obfs4 port.
PT_PORT=9050
# Your email address.
EMAIL=me@somewhere.com
# If you want, you could change the nickname of your bridge
#NICKNAME=DockerObfs4Bridge
# If needed, activate additional variables processing
OBFS4_ENABLE_ADDITIONAL_VARIABLES=1
# and define desired torrc entries prefixed with OBFS4V_
# For example:
OBFS4V_AddressDisableIPv6=1
```

> ![NOTE]
> I'm not using IPv6 at home (working on AT&T on this) so I disabled it in the config, but keep it in if you're using it

You can use [this service](https://bridges.torproject.org/scan/) to test if your port is forwarded correctly and if the obfs4 bridge port is reachable to the rest of the world.

### Run

Now we can run the bridge and see if everything works. To have docker-compose pull the Docker image and run it

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

Now we can watch the logs to see if everything looks right and it can connect to the Tor network

```shell
docker compose logs -f
```

You know you're successful if it bootstraps to 100%

```shell
[...]

```

## Summary

You now have a Tor Relay setup and working, you can read some of the [post-install](https://community.torproject.org/relay/setup/bridge/post-install/) details including watching for users, and connecting to your bridge to access the Tor network from the [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/), a Firefox based browser that can connect to Tor and open `.onion` links leading you to...

Again, everyone should be able to explore and communitcate on the internet with privacy, so defend human rights and increase everyone's online privacy by running a Tor bridge and making this essenstial service more useful. If you're as into Tor as I am, run their [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/), and consider [supporting the project](https://donate.torproject.org/) via a donation.
