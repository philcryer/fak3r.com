I've been working with the [nginx](https://nginx.org/) webserver for over 20 years, this after years of running (what I considered bloated) [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/), and the slightly improved [lighttpd](https://www.lighttpd.net/). For me, nginx has always focused on being simple, secure, and fast. Over the years they've had plenty of improvements and I've always kept up learning/relearning how to setup sites as securely, and again, simply, as possible.

For 2025 here's now I define my site's http, https, Let's Encrypt certificate paths, 301 redirect, and other settings - all with http2 enabled in the same configuration block. Hard to get simplier than that... so here's my current nginx config for [fak3r.com](https://fak3r.com) (you're soaking in it!)

## nginx version

I'm running the latest stable release of nginx in [Debian GNU/Linux](https://debian.org) (Bookwork, version 12), specific details:

```shell
> nginx -V
nginx version: nginx/1.27.4
built by gcc 12.2.0 (Debian 12.2.0-14)
built with OpenSSL 3.0.11 19 Sep 2023 (running with OpenSSL 3.0.15 3 Sep 2024)
TLS SNI support enabled
```

## nginx configuration file

And finally, the configuration file: `/etc/nginx/sites-available/fak3r.com.conf`

```shell
server {
    listen 80;
    listen 443 ssl;
    http2 on;
    server_name fak3r.com;
    root /var/www/html/fak3r.com;
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/fak3r.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/fak3r.com/privkey.pem;
    ssl_protocols       TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_ciphers         HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem;
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf;

    add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains always";
    add_header X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN;
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;
    add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block";

    if ($scheme = http) {
    return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
    }
}
```

## Wrap-up

To me this is exciting, I feel like nginx is always improving while fighting against feature creep and providing excellent security and performance. Of course we're never done, what tips to you see that I could add? Am I off base on something, is there newer/better ways to handle this? Let me know, best way to reach me currently is email (see 'Contact' page), or [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@fak3r). Thanks!
