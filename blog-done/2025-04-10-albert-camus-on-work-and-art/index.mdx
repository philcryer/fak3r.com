Albert Camus' novel "The Stranger" made me a fan of his writing a long time ago, and I've posted about a quote of his about [privacy and solitude](https://fak3r.com/2021/11/27/albert-camus/) that I was quite drawn to, but today I came across some of this thoughts on art, and work in gerneral.

> If the world were clear, art would not exist.

> It takes time to live. Like any work of art, life needs to be thought about.

> A man's work is nothing but this slow trek to rediscover, through the detours of art, those two or three great and simple images in whose presence his heart first opened.

> The aim of art, the aim of a life can only be to increase the sum of freedom and responsibility to be found in every man and in the world. It cannot, under any circumstances, be to reduce or suppress that freedom, even temporarily.

> A guilty conscience needs to confess. A work of art is a confession, and I must bear witness.

> It's not the struggle that makes us artists, but Art that makes us struggle.

> In order to be created, a work of art must first make use of the dark forces of the soul

> Every authentic work of art is a gift offered to the future.
