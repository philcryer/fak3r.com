What can I say about this year? Fuck it for [stopping my live concert attendance March 10](https://fak3r.com/music-concerts/), but look, bands still put out amazing music! Some with the pandemic as a driver, and others without. Regardless, I think this was an excellent year for music after I openly wondered if not having the live component would kill it (it did not).

## The top 12

I dislike ranking my favorite music of they year since there are so many different aspects that appeal to me, it just doesn't seem fair. Regardless I have to have a 'tops' list, and here it is, listed alphabetically.

## The parting shot

Well it was terrible year for [losing musicians](https://www.npr.org/2020/12/31/950086106/in-memoriam-2020-the-musicians-we-lost), too many to list, but these two really hit personally.

* Justin Townes Earle - you'll really be missed. Sad I only saw you 3 times, and that was on your last tour. An amazing songwriter and voice, no one like him. If you haven't heard him, might as well start with the lead off track from his last album, [The Saint Of Lost Causes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9pXYG1ZITk)

* MF DOOM - as if 2020 wasn't enough of a downer, we learned of this on the last day of the year. He was the top of his genre, the comment "your MC's favorite MC" says it all. Hard to pick something to start with here if you haven't heard him, so I'll just go with my favorite, [THAT'S THAT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djOhV-55qTk)
