It's another year where music led me to unexpected places. I enjoyed finding out about new bands/sounds via the internet, as always, but even more so in person, thanks to amazing music festivals like [Gonerfest](https://goner-records.com/pages/gonerfest), which I was lucky enough to finally attend. I need to add more thoughts and images to this post, but for now...
