Through music, he found his catharsis. The Smiths only released four albums in their short tenure as a band, including 1984’s self-titled debut, 1985’s Meat Is Murder, 1986’s The Queen Is Dead and finally 1987’s Strangeways, Here We Come. The group would break up shortly after. In 1987, their American record label, Sire Records, released Louder Than Bombs, a compilation album of The Smiths’ best work. Rolling Stone named it one of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in 2003. From the instrumental brilliance of “Oscillate Wildly” and the irreverent “Shoplifters of the World Unite” to the sarcastic “Heaven Knows I’m Miserable Now” and the nostalgic feel of “Back to the Old House,” it captured a wide range of emotions.

“I think it’s a very loving record from start to finish, and although it’s loving, it spares no punches,” he said. “So as you listen to it you feel you’re in a caring world that just happens to be quite brutal and also completely realistic. It wasn’t rock fantasy, and it wasn’t fake, and it spoke directly, and it was unmarketable. But it sold very, very well.”
