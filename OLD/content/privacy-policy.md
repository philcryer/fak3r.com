What you should know when visiting my site, fak3r.com; pay attention, this stuff is important!

<h3>Does fak3r.com use cookies?</h3>
<p><b>NO</b>, I do not use cookies.</p>

<h3>Does fak3r.com track users in any way?</h3>
<p><b>NO</b>, I do not track users in any way, and in fact I've even gone to the trouble of disabling some javascript that get web fonts which can also track you! I *highly* recommend you run the <a href="https://www.eff.org/privacybadger">Privacy Badger</a> plugin in your browser so you can verify my claims yourself, and defend yourself against other tracking agents online. It's an educational process I wish everyone would go through to better understand the "free" internet, and how they're paying with their private data.</p>

<h3>Does fak3r.com disclose any information to outside parties?</h3>
<p><b>NO</b>, I do not collect, thus I do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. Also, since I don't have it, I will never release any of your information to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety. Additionally, non-personally identifiable visitor information is not being collected, so I could never provide that data to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.</p>

<h3>Then why are you telling me this?</h3>
<p>Because you're being watched online. The average website has around 14 cookies per page; roughly 32 percent come from the website owner, and the rest come from third parties. (Source: <a href="http://www.truste.com/uk-privacy-index-2012-websites/">TRUSTe Privacy Index</a>)</p>
