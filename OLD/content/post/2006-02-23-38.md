Running Typo trunk with today’s latest Revision: 993
Using Markdown with Smartypants text filter (still fails when changed to ‘none’)



	
  1. I created an article with the name ‘??????’ and saved it.

	
  2. Everything within Admin works fine, you can modify things, edit it, etc.

	
  3. When you click on ‘View page on your blog’ from the Admin pages, or just navigate to the article directly with a link it doesn’t make it to the article page.  For demo:
[http://fak3r.com/articles/2006/02/23/??????]

	
  4. Instead of reaching http://fak3r.com/articles/2006/02/23/?????? you land on the page http://fak3r.com/articles/2006/02/23/ – which is really only a listing of articles posted that day.

	
  5. Then, if you click on the article’s title (‘??????’) it just reloads the same page, but notice that when you hover over the ‘??????’ you again see the URL: http://fak3r.com/articles/2006/02/23/ – missing the /??????

	
  6. If you hover over ‘No comments’ you’ll see that that points to:
http://fak3r.com/articles/2006/02/23/#comments
whereas it _should_ point to:
http://fak3r.com/articles/2006/02/23/??????#comments
and then get translated later.


**– HOWEVER –**

If I do a ‘live search’ for ‘??????’ it returns the only result, and drops you to the article page, this time the URL lists:
http://fak3r.com/articles/search?q=%3F%3F%3F%3F%3F%3F

So somewhere in the article URL creation we’re not getting the special characters translated, but this seems to be working within live search.  I’ll leave the page up for reference, let me know if there are any questions, thanks.
