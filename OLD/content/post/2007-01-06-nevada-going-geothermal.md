A new report from the Geothermal Energy Association shows that Nevada is going after geothermal energy, a limitless, pollution free energy solution. "_Nevada is on-track to be producing more than 1000 megawatts (MW) of geothermal power in the next 3-5 years, a level that would meet roughly 25% of the state's total power needs, according to a new report from the [Geothermal Energy Association](http://www.renewableenergyaccess.com/rea/partner/story;jsessionid=3A8AF2D59C85C53E0C9659E32F8C117F?id=46945)[here](http://www.geo-energy.org/publications/reports/Geothermal%20Resource%20Development%20in%20Nevada%202006.pdf) (GEA). The report identifies up to 29 new geothermal power projects now under development in Nevada and finds that new power plants would produce as much as 853 MW.
