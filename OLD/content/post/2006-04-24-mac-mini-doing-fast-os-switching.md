**UPDATE**: it looks like it would only cost an additional [about 78$](http://www.crucial.com/store/listparts.asp?Mfr%2BProductline=Apple%2BMac+mini&mfr=Apple&tabid=AM&model=Mac+mini+%28Intel+Core+Duo+-+1.66GHz%29&submit=Go) for a 512Meg RAM chip to bring this puppy up to 1G total.  OS X seems to ‘need’ at least 1G RAM in my experience, plus this would be way more than enough to run a few OSs at once, or at least the ones I need; OS X and Linux.  Looking around it seems that replacing the RAM is [quite the adventure](http://www.applefritter.com/Mac_Mini_Take_Apart_Guide)!  Time to find my tweezers.
