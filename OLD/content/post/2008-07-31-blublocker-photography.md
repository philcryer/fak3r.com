Here's a cool idea, shoot pictures through some old Blublocker sunglasses and you get [Blublocker photography](http://www.dirtyworldnews.com/2008/02/blublocker_photography.php)!  While I've shot through different lenses before I never thought of aiming through sunglasses, but it makes sense, it's just another filter.  Judging by the shots he's [posted on flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/dirtyworldnews/tags/blublockers/), it gives things an almost otherworldly Mars-like appearance.  Cool effect, I'd like to see this done in a low light enviroment to see what really stands out.
