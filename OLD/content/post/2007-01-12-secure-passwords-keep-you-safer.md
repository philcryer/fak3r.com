[Bruce Schneier](http://www.schneier.com/), a long time computer security guru, has a great [article up on Wired](http://www.wired.com/news/columns/0,72458-0.html) about passwords, and how most are crackable even with some thought put in to making them safe.  Read up and learn how to build better passwords, and if you're like me and can't remember them all use something like [Password Safe](http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/06/password_safe.html) (created by Schneier) for Windows. or [Password Gorilla](http://www.fpx.de/fp/Software/Gorilla/), which is bassed on Password Safe, but available for Windows, OS X, Linux and *BSD. And no, using 'leetspeak' like _fak3r_ instead of _faker_ doesn't help make your password safer!
