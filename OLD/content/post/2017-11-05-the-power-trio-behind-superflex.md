This documentary about [Superflex](http://www.superflex.net/), a Danish art collective responsible for the current main hall exhibition at [Tate Modern](http://www.tate.org.uk/visit/tate-modern) in London, is remarkable. Artists Jakob Fenger, Rasmus Nielsen and Bj√∏rnstjerne Christiansen, are Superflex, who are, "<i>...famous for getting audiences involved in artworks, which playfully challenge conventions.</i>" Some of the conceptual ideas that their work has pushed are really eye opening, and it follows my long held belief; if you have to ask, "But is it art?", then I think the answer is always "Yes". If something forces you to look at something you thought you knew differently, it has done its job, and it is certainly art.

After watching this documentary even I was questioning some of my long held conventions on art, and wondered how I could create a similar experience, and if I could do it just with painting, or with more of a installation piece.
