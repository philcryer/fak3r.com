### "**I'll be long gone before some smart person ever figures out what happened inside this Oval Office.**"




_George W. Bush, Washington DC, 12 May, 2008_






> * So I did some checking to get a source for this, and as I expected, it's slightly taken out of context (Bush was trying to infer that someone would be _impressed_ with what he accomplished).  The interview was done by Shmuel Rosner of Haaretz.com - you can see the [full transcript here](http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/rosnerBlog.jhtml?itemNo=982914&contrassID=25&subContrassID=0&sbSubContrassID=1&listSrc=Y&art=1).
