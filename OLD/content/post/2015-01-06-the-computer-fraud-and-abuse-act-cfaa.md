From an article about the [court case against weev](https://medium.com/backchannel/the-trolls-lawyer-8bf7b2283) (yes he's a creep, but he still has rights) is an apt, consise definition of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) and how it's being used/abused today.

>"... the CFAA, a law passed 30 years ago before every home — indeed, every person’s pocket or purse — held a computer. The CFAA is an anti-hacking statute that makes it a crime to obtain information from a computer “without authorization.” Since lawmakers never spelled out exactly what they meant by that, prosecutors have, over the years, stretched the law to encompass all sorts of harmless activities. Violate a website’s terms of service by lying about your identity, for example, and you could be charged under the Act. Same goes for misusing your employer’s computer at work."

While [Wikipedia points out that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act), "The Act has been amended a number of times—in 1989, 1994, 1996, in 2001 by the USA PATRIOT Act, 2002, and in 2008 by the Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act", it's important to undstand that:

>The only computers, in theory, covered by the CFAA are defined as "protected computers". They are defined under section 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(2) to mean a computer:
>
>	- exclusively for the use of a financial institution or the United States Government, or any computer, when the conduct constituting the offense affects the computer's use by or for the financial institution or the Government; or
>	- which is used in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce or communication, including a computer located outside the United States that is used in a manner that affects interstate or foreign commerce or communication of the United States...
>
>In practice, any ordinary computer has come under the jurisdiction of the law, including cellphones, due to the inter-state nature of most internet communication.

Simply stated, this is a law that could ensnare anyone that is online that's ever fudged their birthdate, or mis-represented themselves when signing up for something simply because they don't want to get more spam - or perhaps if they (shutter) want to protect their privacy. Really, the CFAA is something that needs to be overturned/updated for today's computer usage.
