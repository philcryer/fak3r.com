Here's another great band from Austin that I'm now only hearing about after being away for two years, [Explosions in the Sky](http://www.explosionsinthesky.com/).  In my defence, while I've heard of these guys, they've only been putting out discs since 2000, so I haven't missed that much, but they are very good.  Think of Godspeed You Black Emporer  and Mogwai; two great tastes that taste great together.  Here's their appearance on Conan O'Brien with them doing _Welcome, Ghosts_.  They had to be quick with this one, as most of their songs are much longer, but still they do a good job at it and it's a great intro for the unconverted.  For other samples there's a [live in the studio performance](http://www.kvrx.org/locallive/performance.php?pid=515) from 2000 at KVRX in Austin or a [really great show](http://www.archive.org/details/eits2004-02-09.sbd.rob.shnf) from 2004 on Internet Archive.  After that, go buy some CDs.   RIYL - Mogwai, Godspeed You Black Emporer, M83, and Mono
