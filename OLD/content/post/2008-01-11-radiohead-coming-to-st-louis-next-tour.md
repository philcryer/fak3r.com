, 05-14 St. Louis, MO - Verizon Wireless Amphitheatre

So it's been confirmed, Radiohead [**will **play St. Louis on this tour](http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/entertainment/stories.nsf/music/story/24EFFAEEC8A96E17862573CB00818C53?OpenDocument); what incredible news.  I last saw them during the tour for _The Bends_, far, far too long ago.  "_St. Louis is confirmed as a stop on British rock band Radiohead’s upcoming North American tour. Exact dates and venues are to be announced. The tour will be broken down in two parts – a first leg prior to a European summer tour, and another leg after the European tour. Radiohead’s "In Rainbows" CD is the top-selling album in the country this week._"  F - yes!  I have seen far too many concerts of them on video - must see the new shit live...so damn cool.
