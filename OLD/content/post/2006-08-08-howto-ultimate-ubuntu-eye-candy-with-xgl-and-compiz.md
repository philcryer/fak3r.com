Back a few months I installed Compwiz/Xgl, (developed by [Novell](http://www.novell.com/)) on Ubuntu.  While it was still really new, I liked using it and was looking forward to seeing how it progressed.  Well, it's progressed quite well, and now I've found a simple (and easy to back) way to [install and run Compwiz on Ubuntu 6.06](http://www.tectonic.co.za/view.php?id=916).  If you haven't heard about it, Compwiz is, "_An OpenGL powered desktop, Composite, OS X-rivalling effects_", which just means it makes using your desktop a blast, and more productive, which I agree with.  For an illistration checkout [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUSn-jBA3CE) and [these screenshots](http://images.google.com/images?client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial_s&q=xgl+&hl=en&btnG=Search+Images) for the fun, but wait until you use it.  While it looks like fluf, this is far more useful than any 'eye-candy' I've ever seen.  Mark this on my 'todo' list for tonight, we'll see if it runs on the iBook smoothly.
