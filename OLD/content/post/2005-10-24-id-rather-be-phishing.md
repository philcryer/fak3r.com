It seems that the phishing site I [referred to earlier](http://fak3r.com/articles/2005/10/21/new-phisher-site-to-fight) is now dead (request timed out!)  Yah, very cool, now how about another one to keep the ball rolling?  Go ahead and try out this one: [this one](http://www.phishfighting.com/Fighting.aspx?phType=Paypal&phURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.medicallab.com.tw%2F%2520%2Fhttps%3A%2Fwww.paypal.com%2Fcgi-bin%2Fwebscr%2Fupdate.html&Submit1=Go), YAPPS (yet another pay-pal scam).  Feel free to open a bunch of tabs on that URL; I'll throw up a new one once it goes down.  This would be a good application for that 'flash mod' type of ideal; get a phish-fighting email list, send out a URL like this and have 100s of folks hit it at once.  Itâ€™d be more like a (more coordinated) 419 attack.
