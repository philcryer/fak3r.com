In September 2012, Adobe released its second open source (under the Open Font License 1.1) typeface family, <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2012/09/source-code-pro.html">Source Code Pro</a>. This is a monospaced version of the first one, Source Sans Pro, and that's significant because I'm always looking for a good, monospaced font I can use in my terminals. This one looked like a great option to try out, so I downloaded it and gave it a run. Below are the steps to manually install it via the command-line, and while this is in Ubuntu, Debian and other Linuxes should work the same way, but as always YMMV. So let's get started.

<br/ >First up, we need to get the files

    wget --output-document=/tmp/fonts.zip http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/sourcecodepro.adobe/SourceCodePro_FontsOnly-1.017.zip

Now we need to unpack them

    cd /tmp
    unzip fonts.zip

Now we have a choice, we can install the fonts system-wide, or just for your user (if you don't have sudo, or don't want to install it system wide). First we'll install it for the one user.

    mkdir ~/.fonts
    cp /tmp/SourceCodePro_FontsOnly-1.017/TTF/*ttf ~/.fonts

For system wide installation, we just need to copy the fonts to /usr/share/fonts, to remind yourself in the future that these were added we'll put them in our own directory.

    cd /usr/local/share/fonts
    sudo mkdir myfonts
    sudo cp /tmp/SourceCodePro_FontsOnly-1.017/TTF/*ttf myfonts

Lastly we have to run fc-cache to rebuild the font cache

    fc-cache

You'll need to close any terminals you have open, then reopen one. From here it may vary depending on what term you're using, I use and recommend <a href="http://software.jessies.org/terminator/">Terminator</a>, so I just have to right-click, choose Preferences, hit the Profiles tab, uncheck the <i>Use the system fixed width font</i> box, and click on the font selector button below it. From here it's up to personal preference, but I scrolled through all the font selections and tried a few before I finally ended up using <b>Source Code Pro Semibold 9</b>. The 9 point font is just about right for my 13" MacBookPro screen and while the characters seem a bit shorter, maybe more square than rectangle, they're very readable, which is the key.
