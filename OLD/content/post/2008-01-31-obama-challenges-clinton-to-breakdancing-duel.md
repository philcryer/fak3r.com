Ok, now to lighten the mood a bit after my prior post, apparently [Obama has challenged Hillary to a breakdancing showdown](http://www.crystalair.com/content.php?id=0R200801009), who saw this coming?  With Clinton could result in splintering the Democratic party. Apparently Barack is, "..._planning to "turn the tables and take it old school. Bring your cardboard, woman, and that busted hair, because we are going to settle this with a break-off," Obama told the crowd at a press conference in Reno. "Two dancers enter, one leaves._" [...] "_I'm way blacker than Obama," an exasperated Clinton said._" There's already bold predictions from each camps' inner circle, "_It's a fascinating strategy, but I think B-Boy Barack is grossly underestimating the moves of Hillary," noted political consultant James Carvel. "She has been known to pop and lock with the best of them, and nobody does a suicide better than H'dub._"  This should make the one on one debates far more entertaining...too bad Kucinich isn't still in the race, I suspect he has some awesome moves.
