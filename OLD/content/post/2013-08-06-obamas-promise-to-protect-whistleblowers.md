With all that's gone on with Snoden, it's dissappointing to find that the <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/">Sunlight Foundation</a> has reported that Obama's promise To <i>'Protect Whistleblowers'</i> has <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130726/01200123954/obama-promise-to-protect-whistleblowers-just-disappeared-changegov.shtml">disappeared From Change.gov</a>. While this turn of events isn't surprising now, does anyone remember back when Obama was promising *greater government transparency* and support for whistleblowers? Of course nothing is ever really *deleted* from the internet, so I found it <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130607161858/http://change.gov/agenda/ethics_agenda/">here at Archive.org</a>. The full text is (was):

> <b>Protect Whistleblowers</b>: Often the best source of information about waste, fraud, and abuse in government is an existing government employee committed to public integrity and willing to speak out. Such acts of courage and patriotism, which can sometimes save lives and often save taxpayer dollars, should be encouraged rather than stifled. We need to empower federal employees as watchdogs of wrongdoing and partners in performance. Barack Obama will strengthen whistleblower laws to protect federal workers who expose waste, fraud, and abuse of authority in government. Obama will ensure that federal agencies expedite the process for reviewing whistleblower claims and whistleblowers have full access to courts and due process.
