**UPDATE**: check it - now MoveOn has, [free buttons available](https://political.moveon.org/obamabuttons/?id=-5466147-H9kGlIx&rc=ads.adwords.img728x90) too.

It's old news now, but earlier today [Obama](http://BarackObama.com) chose Senator Joe Biden to be his running mate.  What a great pick, I've always been a fan of Biden, especially his appearances on The Daily Show.  He has generally voted with Obama, and along party lines but has been outspoken on many issues.  He's a seasoned congressional veteran well-versed in foreign policy and national security issues which should help blunt Republican attacks on Obama's lack of experience in these areas.  You can get a Free Obama/Biden bumper sticker over at [MoveOn](http://pol.moveon.org/barackstickers/?id=-5466147-H9kGlIx&rc=manual_forward).Â  Man, November can't come fast enough!  Obama and Biden FTW in 08
