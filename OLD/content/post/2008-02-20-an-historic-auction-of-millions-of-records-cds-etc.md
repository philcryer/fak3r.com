[ all the more.Â   In the end, what I like about this auction is the seller's mindset that the music belongs to everyone, and is not just some commodity.  "_Mawhinney says he'd like the collection to be available to the public, which is a proviso of the sale. "I want the history of American popular music to be available for future generations," he told The Toronto Star. The buyer is required to either donate the collection or create a public space for people to access it._"  It sounds perfect for the Library of Congress, but apparently they didn't have the funds.
