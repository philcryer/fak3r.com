.  "_Texans' fondness for large, manly vehicles has helped make the Lone Star State the biggest carbon polluter in the nation. The headquarters state of America's oil industry spewed **670 million metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in 2003, enough that Texas would rank seventh in the world if it were its own country**, according to the most recent figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. **The amount is more than that of California and Pennsylvania — the second- and third-ranking states — combined**. A multitude of factors contribute to the carbon output, among them: Texas' 19 coal-burning power plants; a heavy concentration of refineries and chemical plants; a lack of mass transit; and a penchant among ranchers and urban cowboys alike for brawny, gas-guzzling trucks — sometimes to haul things, but often just to look Texas tough._"  Obviously living in Austin I didn't see as much of this, but when we'd visit Houston you could see the facts to support the above claims; it was a mess.
