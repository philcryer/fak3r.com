**Your Earth Day To-Do List!**

The bad news: Global warming is real. The better news: there are **real** ways you can help. 

In honor of Earth Day, here are five things you can do to make a cleaner planet and a better tomorrow. The best part is they are low-cost or free -- but have a huge impact. 

![globe](http://www.workingforchange.com/webgraphics/wald/globe.gif)**1. Reduce.** Here's a bright idea: Swap out five standard light bulbs for energy-saving compact fluorescents. They use 25% less energy and last 10 times as long. Other ways to save: unplug unused appliances and take public transit. For more cool tips, go to the [Natural Resources Defense Council website](http://act.actforchange.com/cgi-bin7/DM/y/htQd0PFRjz0UGh0Baeg0EZ).

Offset.** Once you've done what you can to reduce your impact on the environment, offset the rest. Make a donation to reverse the greenhouse gases you produce. Go to [CarbonFund.org](http://act.actforchange.com/cgi-bin7/DM/y/htQd0PFRjz0UGh04EJ0Eh).

Take Action. **We need bold action to solve the climate crisis. The United States is currently responsible for nearly 25% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, so we need to take the lead in solving the problem. Senators Boxer and Sanders have come forward with a bill to achieve 80% emissions reductions by 2050; [click here to support the Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act](http://act.actforchange.com/cgi-bin7/DM/y/htQd0PFRjz0UGh0Baem0Ef).
