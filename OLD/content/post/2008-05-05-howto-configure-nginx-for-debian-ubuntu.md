<p><img src="/2008/nginx_small.png" align="right">**UPDATE: **I'm reworking my config blending in the security ideas found on [camomel.org](https://calomel.org/nginx.html) they're really thought things through on this, this should make for a very secure environment.</p>

<p>I'm always trying new software, and with the webserver I've moved from Apache 1.3 to 2.0 to 2.2, and then later I moved everything over to Lighttpd, which I've liked, save for some memory issues that popped up.  Now, enter a web server named [nginx](http://nginx.net/) (engine x), written by a Russian hacker.  It's already proved it's meddle by running some of the largest Russian sites for years now.  It has the [speed of Lighttpd](http://superjared.com/entry/benching-lighttpd-vs-nginx-static-files/), but with none of that memory weirdness, plus it uses a fraction of the CPU, so scaling should be smooth for highly visited sites.  It also does cool things like load balancing, reverse proxy, IMAP and POP proxy, etc, so I can see it being used in a variety of ways on a network.  It took me some time to understand [how to configure it](http://wiki.codemongers.com/Main), which was a case of me just making it harder than it really is, so I wanted to post it here.  Look for updates as we go along, but this is currently backing a Production site I manage.
