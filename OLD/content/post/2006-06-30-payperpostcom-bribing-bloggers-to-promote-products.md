"Ted Murphy, CEO of advertising firm [Mindcomet](http://www.mindcomet.com/), has launched a new service called [PayPerPost.com](http://payperpost.com/).  You guessed it, itâ€™s a marketplace for companies to connect with bloggers who are willing to blog about a product - for a price.  The companies can set guidelines for their requests such as whether a picture must be included and whether they will only pay for positive blog coverage.  There does not appear to be any requirement that the payment for coverage be disclosed.  There is a requirement that PayPerPost.com must approve your post before you are paid.  Wow."
