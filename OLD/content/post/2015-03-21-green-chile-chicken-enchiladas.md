And now for something completely different, it's a followup to my only other cooking post, [Migas](https://fak3r.com/2012/03/16/migas/). Keeping it in the Mexican/Tex-mex realm, today we're going to make some green chile chicken enchiladas!

The recipe should serve 4, you'll have 8 enchiladas, so with the appropriete sides, salsa, chips and some [cervezas](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cerveza), you should be all set! 

## Ingredients

* 1 15-ounce can enchilada sauce
* 4 cups (about 1 pound) this can be chopped rotisserie (traditional) other cooked chicken
* 1 small red or green bell pepper, cored and diced
* 4 green chiles; poblano (recommended) or Anaheim and California (mild)
* 1 or 2 jalape√±o peppers, seeded and chopped
* 1 6-ounce bag shredded Mexican blend, Cheddar or Monterey Jack cheese
* 8 packaged flour tortillas (large, either flour or corn, your preference)
* 1 casserole pan, medium sized (approximately 9" x 13") 
* Salt and black pepper

(_Optional: sour cream, guacamole and/or salsa for serving_) 

## Prep

1) Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F

2) In the casserole pan

* pour about a 1/3 of the can of enchilada sauce
* line the tortillas up crosswise in the pan, folded open like taco shells
* put about about 1/2 cup of the cooked chicken into each enchiladas
* divide the peppers, chiles evenly between the tortillas, sprinkling them over the chicken
* put about 1 tablespoon shredded cheese over the pepper, chiles, etc
* drizzle about 1 tablespoon enchilada sauce over the filling
* now roll the tortillas up so the seamed side of each tortilla is face-down in the pan 
* pour the rest of the enchilada sauce evenly across the top of the tortillas
* top with the remaining cheese. 

## Bake

Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the cheese is evenly melted and bubbly. 

## Serve

Scoop out a couple of enchiladas on a plate and serve with black beans, chips, salsa, whatever you'd like.

## Leftovers

One thing I'm working on is cooking things ahead of time so you have good meals in the future. With the enchiladas you can do this and have them all ready for the next time you want some. Basically do the above steps (maybe make 2x or 3x as many, again up to you), then:

* allow them to cool to room temperature
* break them out into basic serving sizes, or just 2 per each into individual lidded freezer-safe containers
* throw them in the freezer

Enjoy!
