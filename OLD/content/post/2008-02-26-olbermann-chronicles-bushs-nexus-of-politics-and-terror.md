Watching the "coincidences" between political decisions and terror alerts since 2001 (we're [currently at Bert!](http://www.geekandproud.net/terror/)) has been a favorite spectator sport of mine, but of course it takes Keith Olbermann to fully chronicle the ongoing Bush legacy.   Called "[The Nexus of Politics and Terror](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/02/23/olbermann-timeline-how-t_n_88110.html)" it provides "_...the Bush administration's exploitation of terror threats for political gain. Olbermann's exhaustive account weaves from each revelation of an intelligence failure or a Democratic political victory to an almost immediate orange alert or "new threat" from al Qaeda._  The clip is 17 minutes long and entirely worth it, and its conclusion — **"what we were told about terror, and not told, for security reasons, has overlapped considerably with what we were told about terror, and not told, for political reasons"** — is a telling summary of our past six years.  It will be interesting to see how history judges these events.
