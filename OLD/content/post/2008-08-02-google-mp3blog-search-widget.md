Found this mashup of a script that searches +5000 mp3blogs for tunes.  Just type something in and see what you can find.  I still contend that MP3s are the best way to discover new music - and having something so open like this allows you to hear any band you can think of.  Put quotes around multi-word entries to narrow things down. (ie- "The Smoking Popes")

This was a gadget/script someone wrote so you get directed to his page, I want to look into making my own search like this, but have it be a stand-alone, down loadable script, maybe in PHP.
