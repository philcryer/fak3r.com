[This](http://www.shortnews.com/shownews.cfm?id=59717) could be interesting...  "_Search engine giant Google has announced it will be photographing the Australian city of Sydney this Friday, Australia Day, and is **encouraging Australians to come out and hold signs, or arrange themselves into funny formations**.  If the photos are of a good enough quality, Google Australia has promised that the photos will be included on Google Maps, the free mapping software offered globally by the company. Google has special permission to fly at 600m across the city. Google Australia's Lars Rasmussen said: "This is the first time we have tried this on any scale. We have no idea whether it will work, but we thought it'd be fun to try." The flight will start at 9am over Centennial and Moore Parks._"  Knowing Aussies' sense of humor I expect good things.  Of course whomever is on the [Bridgeclimb](http://www.bridgeclimb.com/) at the time will have a real opportunity!  (I went on the Bridgeclimb in 1999 - highly recommended!)
