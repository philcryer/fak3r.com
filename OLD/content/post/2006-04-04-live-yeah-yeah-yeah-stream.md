> **UPDATE**: As before, NPR did release it as one big mp3 after the show! Grab it here: [Yeah Yeah Yeahs live at the 9:30 club in DC - April 3, 2006](http://download.npr.org/anon.npr-mp3/asc/live/20060403_asc_yyy.mp3),  because your iPod needs to be fed.

[](http://www.npr.org/music/liveconcerts/yeahs/yeahs_big.jpg)[NPR](http://npr.org) has been sponsoring a bunch of great indie concerts and archieving them on their site for all to hear later.  Sure most are Real Audio, but they used to have a mp3 version of an entire Bloc Party show.  Anyway tonight (well 9PM EST) they're streaming a show by the Yeah, Yeah, Yeahs at the 930 Club in DC.  The page with the show is [here](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5313569), and they should have a link up to just stream it after the fact.  Nice stuff, I really dug their first disc, "Fever to Tell", as I said in my 'Best of 2003' review, "_Yeah, While this may not be the album that saves rock and roll, it's still a damn fun release. Their minimalistic punk sound is a refreshing look forward and back at the same time. Plus, put their song "Maps" up for single of the year_."  I'm still on the fence (but leaning) about getting tickets for their upcoming St. Louis appearance.
