I hate bizspeak, always have.  Be it _Thinking outside of the box_, _A paradigm shift_, _Getting ramped up_ or _Step up to the plate_, they all offend.  The idea that people use common phrases to make themselves sound like they know what they're talking about drives me nuts.  Today's example heard by the watercooler: _They can put that idea out there to change the mindset, but it's not going to happen overnight_.  Fantastic.  Sometimes during meetings I jot down ridiculous sayings after I hear them mentioned more than once.  Recently I listed _How can we align ourselves_, _Let's define the groups' ownership_, and _Drive down that path_ (over and over and over...).  Of course it seems that anytime someone asks a question of an exec, the exec will start his reply with _That's a very good point_.  Can we start expressing ourselves as individuals again please, or is that something we've _pushed off for Q2_?
