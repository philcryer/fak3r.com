  "_Perhaps most troubling," says the report, "the FBI could not determine in many cases whether the lost or stolen laptop computers contained sensitive or classified information. Such information may include case information, personal identifying information, or classified information on FBI operations." Laptops can also contain goodies like the software that the FBI uses to make its identification badges, a copy of which was installed on a laptop stolen from the Boston Field Office in July 2002._"  If the FBI doesn't keep records of what's installed on their laptops, how can we expect or trust the private sector to secure customer data?   Think about all the websites that have your name/address/etc, and then think of their employees taking their laptops home that may/may not have hooks in to 'secret' data...
