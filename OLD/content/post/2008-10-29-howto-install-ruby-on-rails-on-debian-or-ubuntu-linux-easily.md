[, first install the dependencies for good measure:<!-- more -->

`apt-get -y install ruby irb ri rdoc ruby1.8-dev build-essential`

Then install rubygems and rails:

`apt-get -y install rubygems rails`

Yep, that was easy.  Now create your first rails app to ensure things are working as they should be:

`rails newrailsapp
cd newrailsapp
script/server`

Then hit your server to see it live, hit it in your browser: [http://120.0.0.1:3000](http://120.0.0.1:3000).  Or, if you're like me, you're running it on a remote server, have it bind WEBrick to the IP that you use to access it, so in my case I quit out of WEBrick, and restarted it with:

`script/server --binding=192.168.1.8`

And then hit it via [http://192.168.1.8:3000](http://192.178.1.8:3000) Nice, so much easier than I remember it being.  While I'm posting here, I'll drop a few more links I want to follow, as if I use RoR on upcoming projects I'll need to investigate as we scale to the clouds!
