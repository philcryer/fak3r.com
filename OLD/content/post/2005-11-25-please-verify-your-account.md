Got another PayPay phishing email today, my filters caught it no problem, so now let's pollute their database of username and passwords.  Here's the direct link to the
[Phishfighting page](http://www.phishfighting.com/Fighting.aspx?phType=Paypal&phURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.paypal.com.security-center-outside-alerts.org%2Fwebscr.php%3Fcmd%3DLogIn&Submit1=Go) that will flood the phisher's site with bogus usernames and passwords.  If you're using Firefox I recommend center clicking on the link 5 times (or more) and leave those tabs open for a day (or more).  Have fun.

**UPDATE**: yep, after leaving it there all day while I was out I return to see the link throwing a 503 - server unavailable.  Sweet.  Don't let that stop you, there are plenty more: here's a [fake eBay one](http://www.phishfighting.com/Fighting.aspx?phType=Paypal&phURL=http%3A%2F%2F61.100.180.12%2Fbbs%2Flibrary%2F...%2FSecurityMeasures.php&Submit1=Go), and a [fake PayPay one](http://www.phishfighting.com/Fighting.aspx?phType=Paypal&phURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pitoos.com%2Fwebscr.php%3Fcmd%3DLogIn&Submit1=Go).  Also, I'm flattered that PhishFighting has a quote of mine "_After a good defense we need a good offense - fak3r.com_" in the left column on the front page.
