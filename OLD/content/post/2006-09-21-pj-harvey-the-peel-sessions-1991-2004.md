I've been a fan of [PJ Harvey](http://www.pjharvey.net/) since the beginning, and she continues to amaze me.  Her live DVD from last year was tremendous, and shows how she's grown as an artist even in the past few years, so it's cool that she's now going to release 'The Peel Sessions 1991 - 2004' on Island Records 23rd October 2006.  Of course I already have the collections from '91 (first year I saw her play live) and '93, but having it all in one package will be give a real overview of her art.  "_A collection of P J Harvey’s Peel Sessions will be released for the first time, during a month of commemorative events, to mark the second anniversary of the inspirational broadcaster's death. _ to her seventh album Uh Huh Her, released in 2004. Harvey recorded many sessions with John Peel over the years. Of the release, Lousie Kattenhorn, John’s Producer, said 'John loved the sessions and was thrilled to have Polly record so many for his __show. He considered her a wonderful artist and they were great __friends. It's fantastic that they're coming out on CD’_"
