So my new job requires me to drive 29 miles each way, a big farther than my last job, but since I don't have as much traffic, it doesn't seem to take that much longer, still, I'm using more gas.  Just did a tank to tank to get my miles per gallon, and I'm seeing 26.825 - not bad, but not great, since we're doing just about all highway miles.  Oh well, I'm currently cruising in a secondhand 1998 Honda Accord, 4 cylinder, so I could be doing worse.  This is a good time for me to be sporting a Prius or even my old '87 CRX, but hey, the CRX isn't safe enough for us to trust with our kids, and the Prius would just be a recurring payment that we wouldn't see returns for a long time (if ever).  Once they make those hybrids cheaper though...
