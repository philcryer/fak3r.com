Wow, here’s a track of The Flaming Lips covering Queen’s [_Bohemian Rhapsody_ at SXSW 2006](http://takeyourmedicinemp3.blogspot.com/2006/03/251-sxsw-live-tracks-volume-iii.html) [when the mp3 link goes dead, look for it [via Google](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=The%2BFlaming%2BLips%2B-%2BBohemian%2BRhapsody%2B-%2BSXSW%2B2006.mp3&btnG=Search).  With lyrics like, “…Is this the real life / Is this just fantasy / Caught in a landslide /
No escape from reality / Open your eyes / Look up to the skies and see /
I’m just a poor boy,i need no sympathy…” it’s a perfect selection for them.  I was stuck on _The Soft Bulletin_ for a long time, probably because we saw them four times on that tour in Austin, but fell out on the last release.  Here’s hoping for a return to form on the new one, but regardless, I’d love to see their live circus again anytime they come to town, just so fun.  Did I mention lately that I’m sick over missing SXSW again?  Need more songs!
