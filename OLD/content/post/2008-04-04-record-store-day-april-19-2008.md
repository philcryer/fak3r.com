"On Saturday, April 19, 2008, hundreds of independently owned music stores across the country will celebrate [Record Store Day](http://www.recordstoreday.com/).  On this day, all of these stores will simultaneously link and act as one with the purpose of celebrating the culture and unique place that they occupy both in their local communities and nationally."  There you go, April 19th I expect all of you to visit an independent music store in your area and buy some music; records, cds, 45s, posters, tshirts - hell, consider getting a new turntable, the kind with the USB plugs so you can rip that new vinyl!  I'll be swinging by my neighborhood store, [Euclid Records](http://www.euclidrecords.com/) for sure on that day (and likely before...) - the thought of not having that as an option terrifies me.
