What a [terrible statistic from Texas](http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/4505682.html), "_One out of three Texas students don't graduate, and **more students drop out than finish high school** in the state's largest cities, according to education experts. The research group says more than half of students in Texas' largest cities drop out. The dropout rate among blacks, Hispanics and low-income students is about 60 percent, according to the Center for Education at Rice University. The statewide dropout rate is about 33 percent — or 20 points higher than what the Texas Education Agency reports. Experts warn that the high dropout rate will lead to economic and social problems. Dropouts are more likely to live in poverty, have health problems and end up in jail [...] "We have a huge problem," Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst said._"  I'd say so.
