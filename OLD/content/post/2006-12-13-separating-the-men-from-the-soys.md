".  Yep, apparently it's just that simple folks, Mr Rutz blazes on without nary a mention of sources or anything resembling science, but I'm sure those things will just fall into place.  Here's the gist of his commentary, but feel free to read it yourself from the link above.


>  Homosexuals often argue that their homosexuality is inborn because "I can't remember a time when I wasn't homosexual." No, homosexuality is always deviant. But now many of them can truthfully say that they can't remember a time when excess estrogen wasn't influencing them.


 proof!  Of course there's no mention about how lesbians come to be, but my sneaking suspicion says that it's Dijon Mustard.  What other use can there be for it?  As for anyone ordering out for Chinese tonight, they can rest easy because...


> P.S.: Soy sauce is fine. Unlike soy milk, it's perfectly safe because it's fermented, which changes its molecular structure. Miso, natto and tempeh are also OK, but avoid tofu.


Ah, so soy sauce won't give you the gay, so it's not all bad news!  I stumbled across this nugget thanks to [Right Wing Watch](http://www.rightwingwatch.org/2006/12/soy_makes_you_g_1.html), but have since expanded to take in some of the better titles being given this newly stated information which includes, [It's the Soy, I Tell Ya](http://www.exgaywatch.com/blog/archives/2006/12/its_soy_i_tell.html) to [Soy milk will give you teh ghey](http://hotair.com/archives/2006/12/12/wnd-op-ed-soy-milk-will-give-you-teh-ghey/) or my personal favorite [Gay soy conspiracy revealed!](http://gristmill.grist.org/story/2006/12/12/85411/721)  My title was the top I came up with out of six, so I feel I did my best. Meanwhile back in reality the best scientific debunking comes from a commentary from the [editors of Scientific American](http://blog.sciam.com/index.php?title=eating_soy_will_not_make_you_gay_we_swea&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1) on the topic.  Hmmm, I'll never look at my vegetarian friends the same again! {sarcasm}
