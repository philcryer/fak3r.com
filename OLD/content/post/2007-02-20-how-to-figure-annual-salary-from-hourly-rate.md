It's funny, I've always figured how much an hourly rate transmitted to annual salary by taking the hourly rate and muliplying by 2080 (number of work hours in a year), but today I stumbled across a simplier/quicker way to estimate this on [Life After Coffee](http://www.lifeaftercoffee.com/2006/02/19/how-to-figure-yearly-salary-from-hourly-rate/).  "_...a simple way to estimate yearly income from hourly rate on the fly. Let’s say you are offered a job for $11/hour. If you assume you work 40 hours a week for 50 weeks a year you can simply double the hourly rate and that will be the yearly income in thousands, so $11/hour = $22,000/year._"
