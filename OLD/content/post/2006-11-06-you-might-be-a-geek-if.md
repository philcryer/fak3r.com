Got this in my email today, recommendations from Amazon based on previous purchases. As you can see, I'm a father, and I'm a geek. This week's recommendations: Dora's Book of Manners, FreeBSD 6 Unleashed, Count with Dora!, Good Night, Dora!: A Lift-the-Flap Story, Dora's Big Book of Stories, Network Security Hacks, Secure Architectures with OpenBSD and Linux Server Hacks.

Since I have a few of these, now all I need is: Boots learns about Open Source Software, Dora: GPL vs BSD Licensing Considerations and Stopping Swiper with OpenBSD's Packet Filter Firewall.
