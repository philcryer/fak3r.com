, but the last was the finishing up of the glorious From A Basement On A Hill, and this is simply a collection of seldom to never heard tunes from the period, so it's hardly the rehash you usually see.  Regardless, this set replaces crummy mp3s that I have of some of these, while putting them in perspective with their brethren.

Gentle voice, familiar minor chord changes, brilliant writing, it's here for all to hear; thanks Elliot.  Close your eyes and enjoy the view of the new moon...
