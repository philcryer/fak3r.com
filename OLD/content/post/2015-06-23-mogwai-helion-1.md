One of my all time favorite bands <a href="http://www.mogwai.co.uk/">Mogwai</a> (still #2 on my <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/fak3r/library">last.fm listen list</a>) is releasing a career spanning 3 CD / 6 LP set called <a href="http://mogwai.co.uk/news/2346/central_belters_box_set_out_9th_october_+_new_video_for_helicon_1">Belters Box</a>. For the occasion they've released a new video, for an old song, <i>Helicon 1</i>. Directory Graig Murray has this to say about it, "The film you see is made from 100% 35mm stills which I shot off the screen: I used about 100+ rolls which were all individually scanned. All effects you see in the film are physical workings of the negatives (scanner compositing, scratching, liquids etc). Given the logistics of shooting everything discreetly and also in the sea,  the original footage was all shot on an iphone and a go-pro, with some addition animation using 35mm.‚Äù
