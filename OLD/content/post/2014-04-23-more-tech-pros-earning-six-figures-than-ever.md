A new <a href="http://news.dice.com/2014/04/21/tech-pros-earning-six-figures-ever/">report from Dice.com</a>, "...suggests that more tech people are earning
six figures a year than ever. Some 32 percent of full-time tech pros
took home more than $100,000 in 2013, according to the findings, up
from 30 percent in 2012 and 26 percent in 2011. For contractors, the
data is even better: In 2013, a staggering 54 percent of them earned
more than $100,000 a year, up from 51 percent the previous year and 50
percent in 2011. How far that money goes depends on where you live, of
course, but it does seem like a growing number of the world's tech
workers are earning a significant amount of cash."

So while this isn't breaking news, it's encouraging...
