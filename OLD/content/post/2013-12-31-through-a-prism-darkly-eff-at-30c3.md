<p>Here's a great talk from the <a href="http://ccc.de">Chaos Computer Club's</a> current event, <a href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2013/wiki/Static:FAQ">30c3</a> happening now in Munich. Here Kurt from <a href="http://eff.org">EFF</a> gives a great overview of what we know the goverment is doing, and ways to fight against mass surveillance. "<i>From Stellar Wind to PRISM, Boundless Informant to EvilOlive, the NSA spying programs are shrouded in secrecy and rubber-stamped by secret opinions from a court that meets in a faraday cage. The Electronic Frontier Foundationâ€™s Kurt Opsahl explains the known facts about how the programs operate and the laws and regulations the U.S. government asserts allows the NSA to spy on you.</i>"</p>
