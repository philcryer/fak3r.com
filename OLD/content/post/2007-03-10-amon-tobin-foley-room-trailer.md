I'm a big fan of a few of Amon Tobin's previous releases, especially _Briolage.  _He created his upcoming release by recording real sounds from all over, and then taking them back to the studio to sample and mix.  The results are very cool, but they still sound like Amon.  There's a limited edition that comes with a DVD of the process, here's the trailer for it.
