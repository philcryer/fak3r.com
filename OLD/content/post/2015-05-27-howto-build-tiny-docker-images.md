# Overview
For the past year it seems, everyone is trying <a href="http://docker.com">Docker</a>, running processes in containers to make environments more predictable and reproducable. However old habits die hard, and once again I see installations that are far larger with wasted resources at best, and insecure, unused services running at worst. Most people running Docker are using huge images with needless applications installed and taking up space for their containers. Meanwhile, if you search in the Docker Registry for 'debian minimal' you'll come across some images that are over 260 MB! Whenever I build a new server I install Debian/GNU Linux doing a [Network install from a minimal CD](https://www.debian.org/CD/netinst/) which only includes the minimal base OS. My goal is to recreate this for Docker, starting with a base Debian install, and then removing things in that minimal install that are not needed by Docker, while leaving the basic *nix utilities in place. After this I use [docker-squash](https://github.com/jwilder/docker-squash) tool to free a few more bits in the container before committing and checking in the image here. 

## Usage
If  you just want to use this image, pull it and configure what you want:

```
docker pull philcryer/min-wheezy
```

To use this image in your own project, use this FROM line in your Dockerfile:

```
FROM philcryer/min-wheezy:latest
```

## Build
In the interest of Open Source and transparency, here are the steps I've taken to build this image. 

### Pull the official base Debian Wheezy image

*See [Debian Official Docker](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/debian/) page for information on this container*

```
docker pull debian:wheezy
```

### Get the image ID and run the container

*Notice how small it is to start with*

```
# docker images | tail -n1
debian                      wheezy              f6fab3b798be        4 weeks ago          85.1 MB
# docker run -it f6fab3b798be /bin/bash
```

### Inside the container, run the following

```
apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y 
apt-get clean -y && apt-get autoclean -y && apt-get autoremove -y
cp -R /usr/share/locale/en\@* /tmp/ && rm -rf /usr/share/locale/* && mv /tmp/en\@* /usr/share/locale/
rm -rf /var/cache/debconf/*-old && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* && rm -rf /usr/share/doc/*
echo "`cat /etc/issue.net` Docker Image - philcryer/min-wheezy - `date +'%Y/%m/%d'`" > /etc/motd
exit
```

### Commit those changes

```
# docker ps -a | head -n2
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                      PORTS               NAMES

# docker commit  9fd99c47de64
3dd7dab3803b2bb507a576119ac3daf3de9f700cbf0e80127acc04a85891c0d4
```

### Squash the image and get its new ID

```
# docker save 3dd7dab380 | docker-squash -from root -t philcryer/min-wheezy | docker load

# docker images | head -n2
REPOSITORY             TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED              VIRTUAL SIZE
philcryer/min-wheezy   latest              243925c5b6ed        12 seconds ago       50.76 MB
```

### Push it to the Docker registry

```
docker push philcryer/min-wheezy
```

### Results

Pull the image and check the size:

```
# docker pull philcryer/min-wheezy:latest
Pulling repository philcryer/min-wheezy

```
