Ya, you've heard the song _1 2 3 4_ by [Feist](http://www.listentofeist.com/), even if you don't realize it; it's that iPod ad.  That ad gave you a sense of the melody of the song, which is beautiful IMO, as is the cd which easily made my best of 2007.  Why am I bringing this up?  It's the full video, you must see it.  Rarely does a video move me enough to want to talk about it, I can think of some Sigur Ros ones, and a couple of others, but this one is just fantastic and suits the song very well.  Anyway, check it out and let me know what you think, and pickup the cd if you like this track; it's a solid one.
