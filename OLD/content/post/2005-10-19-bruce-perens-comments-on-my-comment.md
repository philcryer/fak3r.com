In the flurry of discussion after one of my [recent posts to Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=165282&cid=13790268), none other than [Bruce Perens](http://perens.com/) (the author, creator of the Open Source Definition, founder or co-founder of the Open Source Initiative, The Linux Standard Base, Software in the Public Interest and No-Code International, and general open source guru) [commented on my post](http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=165282&cid=13790886)!  "_Heavyweights taking on Rails - I visit Fortune 100 companies in my work for Sourcelabs. The managers comment that their engineers are clamoring to use Rails and the managers are holding back until the product is more mature. They continue to watch the trend. There are some interesting sites. Note [Epson Developers](http://www.epsondevelopers.com/).  You might find [this note](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.ruby.rails/24863) about a large medical application interesting. I also noted a Rails project being developed in a department of the New York City government.  Bruce_"
