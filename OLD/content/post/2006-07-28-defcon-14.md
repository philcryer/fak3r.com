; and attending plenty of talks/presentations on all things hack/security/geek/etc.  Looking forward to learning some in-depth security from people in the know; stuff outside of what is generally available to the general public as it were.  Also on the agenda, reminiscing, drinking, eating, not sleeping much and laughing.  I'll have a report on relevant events and topics along with a censored Flickr slide-show for all those Web 2.0 kids to link to soon after the fun.
