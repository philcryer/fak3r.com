Heading out today for Woods Hole, MA - it's supposed to be beautiful (expect pictures on my grossly underused [flickr account](http://flickr.com/photos/fak3r)).  I'm representing the [Biodiversity Heritage Library](http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/) in a meeting with the [Encyclopedia of Life](http://eol.org) folks as we discuss standardizing data streams for upcoming sharing of data.  It may not sound like it, but this is fun.  While I'm on more of the technical end of the spectrum, the way these things will be shared/directed/pushed along the wire is where I'll come in and I'm very interested in their efforts and methods, so I expect to learn a ton.  For more info on EOL and what they're working towards, check the links to some articles below. (that Zemanta feature is pretty slick)
