Modest Mouse's new one, _We Were Dead Before The Ship Sank_, doesn't come out until March 20th, but the video for the first single, _Dashboard_, is already out.  It's a really good song that sounds *more* rocking than their last release; harking back to a bit earlier days, which is good.  And hey, give them credit for the video, it's pretty nice as well, plus I think you can see Johny Marr in the backgroud there near the end, wowser.
