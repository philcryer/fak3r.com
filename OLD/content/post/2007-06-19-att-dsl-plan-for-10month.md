December_." The speeds are what you'd expect for the price, 768 kilobits per second and upload speeds of up to 128 kbps, but this is far and away fast enough for 90% of subscribers I bet, the 'speed' that they try to sell is not something a normal user is going to bump up against.  In what makes it seem even more of a concession instead of a new marketing initiate is that, "_The plan was not mentioned in a Friday news release about AT&T's DSL plans, and is slightly hidden on the AT&T Web site. A page describing DSL options doesn't mention it, but clicking a link for "Term contract plans" reveals it. It's also presented to customers who go into the application process_."  Let's hope this is a sign of things to come, America trails most other countries in high-speed internet usage, and with so much going on online, you really need a high-speed connection to really take advantage of it.  A $50/month 1.5/768 is really not needed by most, it's a rip-off for them, but $10/month is something they would get great benefit from without being fleeced.
