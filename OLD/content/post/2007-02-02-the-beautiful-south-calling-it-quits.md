, which is good, I think they deserve at least that.  The lyrics were some of the most caustic, British words I have seen this side of Morrissey!  "Pop group The Beautiful South have split after 19 years - blaming, with a humour typical of the band, "musical similarities."Formed in 1988 out of the ashes of The Housemartins, the legacy of "the fourth best band in Hull" includes some of the most distinctive songs to make the top end of the charts - as well as perhaps the most-quoted single sales statistic in history. [...] Their most famous songs, such as Song For Whoever, Don't Marry Her and Perfect 10, took the opposite approach to most pop songs - by centering on what relationships that were not about endless love."
