 or other mental issues, and you just have a ticking time bomb. That's my take, I've made this post to say, look, if you have issues, **PLEASE get help and seek treatment**. Tons of people take meds and go to regular therapy to deal with issues, it's not like you're alone; I've been doing both for years now, and feel much better that I'm *dealing* with it this way instead of the way the person did on at Virginia Tech earlier this week. I think things are getting better in this regard since I've seen people's willingness to talk about it becoming more common - because of this I know plenty of people going through the same stuff. Don't think things will just 'get better' on their own, if you're sad, or in an unusual state, talk to a doctor and get help, please. Not that I have much to offer, but I'm around if anyone is ever in a situation like that and needs advice/support/whatever. fak3r at fak3r dot com
