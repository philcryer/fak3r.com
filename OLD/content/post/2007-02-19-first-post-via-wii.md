e.  Plus, after my first round of boxing I had to take a break; it's a real workout, with sweat included.  Time to try the wii sports diet for myself.  So far both kids and wife are lovin' the wii just as much.  In the words of Ferris Bueller, “_It’s so choice. If you have the means, I highly recommend it._”  Also, notice the new wii topic; oh yeah.  More soon...

UPDATE: checking my Apache server logs, the Wii web browser's useragent identifies itself as: `Opera/9.00 (Nintendo Wii; U; ; 1309-9; en)`
