 at age 84.  "_Kurt Vonnegut, whose dark comic talent and urgent moral vision in novels like    "Slaughterhouse-Five," "Cat's Cradle" and "God Bless    You, Mr. Rosewater" caught the temper of his times and the imagination    of a generation, died last night in Manhattan. He was 84 and had homes in Manhattan    and in Sagaponack on Long Island.__ His death was reported by Morgan Entrekin, a longtime family friend, who said    Mr. Vonnegut suffered brain injuries as a result of a fall several weeks ago. Mr. Vonnegut wrote plays, essays and short fiction. But it was his novels that    became classics of the American counterculture, making him a literary idol,    particularly to students in the 1960s and '70s. Dog-eared paperback copies of    his books could be found in the back pockets of blue jeans and in dorm rooms    on campuses throughout the United States. Like Mark Twain, Mr. Vonnegut used humor to tackle the basic questions of human    existence: Why are we in this world? Is there a presiding figure to make sense    of all this, a god who in the end, despite making people suffer, wishes them    well? He also shared with Twain a profound pessimism. "Mark Twain," Mr.    Vonnegut wrote in his 1991 book, "Fates Worse Than Death: An Autobiographical    Collage," "finally stopped laughing at his own agony and that of those    around him. He denounced life on this planet as a crock. He died."__ Not all Mr. Vonnegut's themes were metaphysical. With a blend of vernacular    writing, science fiction, jokes and philosophy, he also wrote about the banalities    of consumer culture, for example, or the destruction of the environment._"  Viewed as a whole, his writings are timeless.
