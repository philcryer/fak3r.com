Sometimes you find something that speaks to you, makes a point that you've tried to make, but it does it so much better. This is one of those quotes, it encapsulates everything I've ever thought about technology and learning.

    You will be newbie forever. Get good at the beginner mode, learning new programs, asking dumb questions, making stupid mistakes, soliciting help, and helping others with what you learn (the best way to learn yourself).
