This is just silly, so apparently during her Grammy performace, Amy Winehouse was told to [cover up exposed breasts...on one of her tattoos](http://www.celebratty.net/amy-winehouse-forced-to-cover-up-topless-tattoo-by-grammy-bosses)!  The reason given was that, "_Grammy bosses were scared she’d offend US audiences_" with her pin-up girl tattoo on her left upper arm.  Really, that   Pla-lee-zz.
