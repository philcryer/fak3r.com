, making it only the second state to allow/acknowledge same sex marriage.  Here's hoping this will be the trend, or at least a precident, for the future.  Which will be the next state to grant the basic right of marriage to everyone?  Human rights, what a concept!  The court's comment is very powerful, "_Our state now recognises that an individual's capacity to establish a loving and long-term committed relationship with another person, and responsibly to care for and raise children, does not depend upon the individual's sexual orientation, and more generally that an individual's sexual orientation — like a person's race or gender — does not constitute a legitimate basis upon which to deny or withhold legal rights._"
