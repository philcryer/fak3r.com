![Barack Obama and Robert De Niro](/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/deniro_372x192.jpg)Today [one of the greats gave Obama the nod](http://www.observer.com/2008/robert-de-niro-obamas-inexperience) at a rally in New Jersey.  He surprised people by seeming attacking the Senator though, "_Barack Obama does not have the experience to be president of the United States. He wasn't experienced enough to authorize the invasion of Iraq. And that's not all, it's clear Barack Obama does not have the experience to let the special interests run the government. That's the kind of inexperience I can get used to. I've never made a speech like this at a political event before, so, what am I doing here? Finally, one person has inspired me_"
