 he still has his problems with it, and doesn’t feel like he shouldn’t bring those up since this is a democracy.  I don’t expect to be the last we hear of this, Morrissey rarely backs down, alas a track from his forthcoming release contains the lyrics, ”_If your god bestows protection upon you / And if the USA doesn’t bomb you / I believe I will see you Somewhere safe_”
