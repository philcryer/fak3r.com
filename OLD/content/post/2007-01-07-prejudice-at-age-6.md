> By age 6, many kids are well schooled in societal prejudice. In a     study, researchers interviewed 92 African-American first- and     sixth-graders from varying socioeconomic backgrounds about job status and     their own interest in particular occupations.

> Children from all economic backgrounds associated white workers     with jobs that they saw as higher in status. Furthermore, when asked     about unfamiliar and even imaginary jobs such as a "tenic," someone who     organizes and marks handicapped parking spaces, children rated careers     pictured with white workers above those depicted with black workers or a     mixed group.

"It's troubling that children in our society take race as something     that defines the status, importance, and pay of jobs," says Lynn S. Liben,     professor of psychology at Pennsylvania State University and coauthor of     the study, published in      _Developmental Psychology_.

> Liben also found that poor children in the sixth-grade group showed     less interest in high status jobs such as a doctor or airline pilot,     which they saw as occupied primarily by whites. She speculates that     underprivileged children in particular may "self-select" away from high     status jobs because they assume a lack of access to the education and     resources needed to attain them.
