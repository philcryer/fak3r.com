A former spammer [comes forth to tell his story](http://news.yahoo.com/s/pcworld/20070718/tc_pcworld/134721), an amazing look at how easy something like this is to get away with.  "_Ed," a retired spammer, built a considerable fortune sending e-mails that promoted pills, porn and casinos. At the peak of his power, Ed says he pulled in US$10,000 to $15,000 a week, storing the money in $20 bills in stacks of boxes._"  In his last year he pulled in $480,000.
