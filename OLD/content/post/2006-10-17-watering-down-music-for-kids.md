I was amused, and then annoyed to learn that there is now a 'kid friendly' cd with Ramones tracks   called [Brats on the Beat:   Ramones for Kids](http://www.aversion.com/news/news_article.cfm?news_id=7443).  Coming out in November on Go-Kart Records, it, "...lets 12 punk and   hard-rock veterans get their Raffi on and recreate classic Ramones songs in a kid-friendly   format."  So the lineup of artists covering them seem cool enough, it will   expose kids to one of the best rock bands ever, which is fantastic, but my beef is, why?  Why water down   something as classic and  series. For   those that haven't seen the commercials, Kidz Bop, "_features newly recorded, kid-sung, and "kid friendly" versions of best-selling hit songs_."  I don't consider myself too much of a fuddy-duddy, but I'd much rather my kids listen to The Ramones singing "I wanna be sedated" or "Beat on the brat with a baseball bat" than some inappropriate Kidz Bop song.  Examples and more commentary after the jump.<!-- more -->

For example, check out they [lyrics](http://www.zokky.com/artist_k/kidz_bop_kids_lyrics/all_i_have_lyrics.html%20on%20Kidz) from the song _All I have_, found on Kidz Bop Volume 10:


> The nights I waited up for you (Oh, boy)
Promises you made about comin' through
So much time you wasted
That's why I had to replace you
Uh, uh, uh It makes a cat nervous,
the thought of settlin' down
Especially me, I was creepin' all over town
I thought my tender touch could lock you down
I knew I had you, as cocky as it sounds
That's the way you used to giggle right before I put it down
It's better when you angry, come here,
I'll prove it now, come here
Stop playin, you gamin' I gotta leave you alone
'Cause I'm good holdin' my spot (Stop actin' like that)
And I'm good reppin' the girls on the block


Again, to some I'll come across as the "You kids get outta my yard" guy, but the the heck is that?  How is this appropriate for kids? The respected site, Parents Center, [reviews a   Kidz Bop cd](http://parentcenter.babycenter.com/reviews/bigkid/gentertainment/view/3-2032) and states, "_This misguided __CD sells very well because it isn't saccharine   sweet and , not some watered down, Kidz Jams foolishness, when they're ready for it.  So,what's next,   reworking classic art to have less nudity and more nursery friendly colors?  Come on, protect   your kids from R-rated movies, monitor online usage and have them wear sweaters when it's cold   out, but don't filter music and art for them; filters are for coffee makers.  Either   they're ready for it or they're not: so just say NO to any homogenization of any kind of art. After all, as Joey said over 30 years ago, "_There no stopping the ki__ds from hopping!_", so why   try?_ _
