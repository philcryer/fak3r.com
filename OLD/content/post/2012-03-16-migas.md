![Migas](/2012/migas.jpg)

I've always loved Mexican food, but it wasn't until I lived in Austin, Texas that I came to really appreciate it. When I worked at Hoover's as a technician, the receptionist would announce when the taco truck pulled up so we could queue up and get breakfast tacos with egg, potato, cheese and salsa. After finding my taste for migas, I realized that I could eat them for every meal, they're that freaking good. I played around making my own for my family for a time, but I finally got serious and started playing with some known recipes. I quickly settled on Rachael Ray's [Mighty Migas](http://www.rachaelrayshow.com/food/recipes/mighty-migas/) recipe, but based mine on the version she has in her book (which is vegetarian) and then over time I've made my own deviations. So, since I've been successful with them, and since I've never posted about cooking, here's my interpretation of how to create migas; pretty much one of my, and my families', favorite meals now. So put on some Willie Nelson, Junior Brown or Don Wasler, and try it out! Give your thoughts and comments below if you have any suggestions, I'm always looking to improve my cooking (I've got a long way to go!)

### Migas
4 servings




#### Ingredients


* 3 tablespoons EVOO - Extra Virgin Olive Oil
* 1 or 2 jalapeño peppers, seeded and chopped
* 1 small red or green bell pepper, cored, seeded and chopped
* 1/2 small white onion, chopped
* Salt and black pepper
* 5 large eggs, beaten
* 1 cup crushed tortilla chips
* 1 5-ounce sack (1 cup) shredded Monterey Jack or Cheddar cheese
* 8 6-inch flour tortillas (soft taco size)
* 1 can diced tomatoes with green chilies, drained (or use 2 plum tomato and 1 cup tomato sauce)
* a handful of fresh cilantro, finely chopped
* Optional: a chipotle chilie in adobo, medium to extra hot, finely chopped


#### Preparation


Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat with 2 turns of the pan of EVOO, about 3 tablespoons. Add the jalapeño, bell peppers, and onion and season with a salt and pepper. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes, then add the tomatoes and cook for 2 more minutes. Beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper and add to the veggies. Reduce heat to medium low. Scramble the eggs not quite halfway, so they are still nice and wet. Add the crushed tortilla chips and scramble them in. Cover the eggs with the cheese and turn off the heat. Cover the pan loosely with foil to melt the cheese and set aside for a minute.

Heat a second, dry skillet over high heat. Add the tortillas one at a time and sear for 30 seconds on each side to blister them.


#### Serving


Place a mound of the migas on each flour tortilla, serve with bowls of cheese, tortilla chips, and a variety of salsas for everyone to add to their migas, and fold and eat. Mexican rice, or pinto beans as a side is an option, but generally I just eat the migas.

Let me know how it turns out, and enjoy!
