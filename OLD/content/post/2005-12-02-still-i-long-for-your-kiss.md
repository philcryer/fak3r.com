"_go find a jukebox, and see what a quarter will do..._"  Even though I spent most of my time listening to indie/punk bands while there, since leaving Austin (almost a year ago now, damn) my warmest memories of living there are brought back by the music of [Lucinda Williams](http://www.lucindawilliams.com/).  Recently I've been listening not only to her recent double-live cd release but her last 4 cds, and it all ages so gracefully.  Now Austin City Limits has released one of her appearances from the 2001/_Car Wheels on Gravel Road_ era.  You can watch her do [Still I Long for Your Kiss](http://acldvd.com/vid/LW_big_QT.htm) (mislabeled as _Greenville_, but...) in QuickTime.   She's great, and from pictures from her appearance at ACL 2005 I noticed her [new tattoo](http://www.cowboysindians.com/articles/0905/images/williams.jpg), which looks awesome...makes me wonder why my right arm looks so blank...  And for the record, I have the cd single for "Passionate Kisses" that I bought after seeing the video on 120 Minutes (yes, it used to be a great show), and this was back in 88 or 89!  So while I haven't been the most consistent Lu fan over the years, call me a recent fan at your peril.
