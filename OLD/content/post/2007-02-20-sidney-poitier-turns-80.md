, that are my favorites.  Very recommended.  Also, his autobiography “The Measure of a Man" was picked by Oprah Winfrey to join her "book club" just last month.  "_Poitier’s book combines memories of such plays and films as “A Raisin in the Sun” and “The Defiant Ones” with observations about the Academy Award-winning actor’s childhood, his religious faith, his thoughts on racism and the influence of such world leaders as Nelson Mandela and Mahatma Gandhi. “He writes really candidly and passionately about his childhood, his family, relationships and his extraordinary career,” Winfrey said on her show, which airs from Chicago. “It really is about what makes character, what makes you be who you are. He is the measure of one of the greatest men I think who has ever been on our planet._”
