Here's my all time favorite Swedish hardcore band, [Refused](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refused), doing "The Shape of Punk to Come" their release of the same name during a set on Jimmy Fallon, July 18th of this year. This is why I want to see them on this reunion tour they're doing, they are just so freaking intense.

Bonus, here they are doing their, for better or worse, most popular song, "New Noise".
