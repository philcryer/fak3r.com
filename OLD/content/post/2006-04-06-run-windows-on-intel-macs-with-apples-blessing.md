 apps do now.  Strange times?  Yes, but hey, Apple stock holders will be happy, many more people will consider and buy Macs now; but long term what will it mean for the Apple experience?  That indescribable feeling of being outside of the mainstream?  I know the Mac faithful will say this is another, “Brilliant move!” by Steve Jobs, and I truly hope it is, but I don’t know right now.  I want it to be, but my gut says it’s not.  Please quote me on this, as I so much want to be wrong.

, ”_All in all, Boot Camp works really well. Whether you want to run Mac or Windows programs, an Apple computer may be the only computer you’ll need_.”  Indeed.
