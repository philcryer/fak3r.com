Birdy Nam Nam (4 DJs from Paris), combine their talents to make one song, for this they won the [DMC World Team Championship](http://www.dmcworld.com/championships/2006/home.asp).  Holy hell...

**UPDATE**: Found an mp3 of another song of theirs : [Kind of Laid Back](http://aurgasm.us/tracks/Birdy%20Nam%20Nam%20-%20Kind%20of%20Laid%20Back.mp3).  Hearing a lot of jazz in there that I really, really like.  They have some more vids [on their site](http://www.birdynamnam.com) (flash warning)
