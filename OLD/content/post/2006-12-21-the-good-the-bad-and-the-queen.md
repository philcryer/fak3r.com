This is just a crazy Brit supergroup, [The Good, The Bad and The Queen](http://www.thegoodthebadandthequeen.com/) features Damon Albarn (Blur, Gorillaz), Paul Simonon (The Clash), Simon Tong (The Verve) and Tony Allen (Africa 70, Fela Kuti).  All of these guys have solid pedigrees coming into this project, add to that Damon who is on a tear with everything outside of Blur that he touches.  Oh, did I mention who's producing?  Yeah, that'd be Dangermouse, who again, seems to have a golden halo lighting everything he's near.  Let's see, so we have Brit-Pop, Punk, Hip Hop, and Afrobeat...and production by the cat who gave us "The Grey Album" and the fantastic "Mouse and the Mask" along with MF Doom.  The debut disc by The Good, The Bad, and The Queen, _Kingdom of Doom_, will drop on January 22nd in the UK, and the following day over here.  Give this track a listen, I think it's going to be a happy new year indeed.
