Last week (September 17 to 25, from 8 am to 8 pm every day) there was a [Floating Island](http://www.whitney.org/exhibition/feat_smithson.shtml) on a tugboat circling Manhattan for all to see. The original concept was dreamt up by Robert Smithson, best know for another of his 'Earthworks'; [Spiral Jetty](http://www.robertsmithson.com/earthworks/spiral_jetty.htm) from 1970. This exhibit was put on by a New York-based arts organization that puts on public art projects, since Smithson died in 1973. 

> _The Floating Island is a project that involves a 30-x-90-foot barge, landscaped with earth, rocks, and native trees and shrubs that will circumnavigate Manhattan. The fabricated "island," towed by a small tugboat, will be on view two weekends in September, visible to millions of residents, commuters, and visitors along the Hudson and East Rivers_.

Here's the [full story](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/16/arts/design/16floa.html?ei=5070&en=71da184f2e2a3f2d&ex=1127966400&adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1127849024-N9MvjZGeeO5f53t2M506yQ). Anyway, that's cool enough, but then some students tailed the barge in a speedboat with a tiny replica of one of The Gates, Christo's [Central Park sculpture](http://www.christojeanneclaude.net/tg.html) from earlier this year. The picture above captures the action. Apparently it was supposed to point out how stupid they thought The Gates project was, but it would have been a better story if it were just "fake gates chases fake park down the river". Also, I've come across a new online resource for Christo's work, the site [Artsy](https://www.artsy.net/) has a [paged devoted to Christo's work](https://www.artsy.net/artist/christo), with examples from 1950s, to working to "... complete unrealized projects such as Over The River, a miles-long stretch of fabric that would function as a canopy over the Arkansas River". Lots of coverage of other 'contemporary' artists on their site too, seems like a great resource.
