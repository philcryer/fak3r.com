[ meme here:
<!-- more -->

You can (and should) get information about changing your account password for any of those sites [here](http://lifehacker.com/5712785/faq-compromised-commenting-accounts-on-gawker-media) and learn how to run an audit of all of your passwords, if you use/trust [Lastpass](http://lastpass.com/), here, but hell, the damage is likely already done. We can only hope that this wakes up other companies, people's personal information shouldn't be so dealth with in such an insecure matter; at what point are they responsible for securing public data further than posting "We care about your privacy!!!" on their 'About' web page?
