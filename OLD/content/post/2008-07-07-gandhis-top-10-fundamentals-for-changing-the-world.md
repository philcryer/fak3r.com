_“You must not lose faith in humanity. Humanity is an ocean; if a few drops of the ocean are dirty, the ocean does not become dirty.”_

_“The difference between what we do and what we are capable of doing would suffice to solve most of the world’s problem.” _

_“If I had no sense of humor, I would long ago have committed suicide.” _

[Mahatma Gandhi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi) needs no introduction. Everyone knows about the man and his incredible words of wisdom, here I print a list I found online once entitled _10 fundamentals for changing the world_, with accompanying quotes from him on the topics.  Read through them and think about how they could be used to improve current situations; from your own, to our countries', to the world.  We can do better and treat others better for the benefit of all, here are some ways.

** 1. Change yourself. **
_ “You must be the change you want to see in the world.” _

** 2. You are in control. **
_“Nobody can hurt me without my permission."_

** 3. Forgive and let it go.**
_ “The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.” _
_ “An eye for eye only ends up making the whole world blind.” _

** 4. Without action you aren’t going anywhere. **
_ “An ounce of practice is worth more than tons of preaching.” _

** 5. Take care of this moment. **
_ “I do not want to foresee the future. I am concerned with taking care of the present. God has given me no control over the moment following.” _

** 6. Everyone is human. **
_ “I claim to be a simple individual liable to err like any other fellow mortal. I own, however, that I have humility enough to confess my errors and to retrace my steps.” _
_ “It is unwise to be too sure of one’s own wisdom. It is healthy to be reminded that the strongest might weaken and the wisest might err.” _

** 7. Persist. **
_ “First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.” _

** 8. See the good in people and help them. **
_ “I look only to the good qualities of men. Not being faultless myself, I won’t presume to probe into the faults of others.” _
_ “Man becomes great exactly in the degree in which he works for the welfare of his fellow-men.” _
_ “I suppose leadership at one time meant muscles; but today it means getting along with people.” _

** 9. Be congruent, be authentic, be your true self. **
_ “Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.” _
_ “Always aim at complete harmony of thought and word and deed. Always aim at purifying your thoughts and everything will be well.” _

** 10. Continue to grow and evolve. **
_ ”Constant development is the law of life, and a man who always tries to maintain his dogmas in order to appear consistent drives himself into a false position.” _
