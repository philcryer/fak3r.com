 stores mainly because they insist the bands allow individual tracks to be downloaded, and they don't want that.  But think about it, if music comes straight from bands without having to pass through a myriad of record execs, or even online music stores, imagine how much truer the music will be to the musician's real idea and concepts.  Wow, this could be a big watershed moment for the music industry, and perhaps art distribution in general...or it could be a mere future trivia question.
