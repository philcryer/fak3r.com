It is written by someone who spends every day building, configuring, and installing custom kernels as part of the development process of this fun, collaborative project called Linux. I'm especially proud of the chapter on how to figure out how to configure a custom kernel based on the hardware running on your machine.  This is an essential task for anyone wanting to wring out the best possible speed and control of your hardware._" He goes on to say that the book is now free for download in order to give others the experience of compiling their own kernel to understand how easy it actually is to contribute to Linux.
