![McDonalds](http://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/mcdonalds_logoe.gif)Right-wing American Family Association (AFA) are boycotting McDonalds of their 'gay agenda'.  They're pissed because McD's Vice President of Communications Richard Ellis’s is serving on the Board of Directors of the National Gay & Lesbian Chamber of Commerce (NGLCC).  Sounds like the end of the world to me, lets get their word on the matter:


> What the boycott of McDonald’s IS about? It is about McDonald’s, as a corporation, refusing to remain neutral in the culture wars. McDonald’s has chosen not to remain neutral but to give the full weight of their corporation to promoting the homosexual agenda, including homosexual marriage.


Oh boy, then the AFA President Donald Wildmon says that it's strange because “_...it’s the family that McDonald’s appeals to — children’s playland, you know, all the little toys, all of that. And they are promoting a lifestyle that would utterly destroy the traditional family._”  Guess I need to tell the gay parents that I know that their great job they're doing raising their kids is DESTROYING the traditional family.  Welcome to a time that isn't the 1950s folks!  Credit to McD's for keeping it real with their rebuttal, "..._We treat our employees and our customers with respect and dignity, regardless of their ethnicity, religious beliefs, sexual orientation or other factors. We support our employees’ personal involvement in organizations of their choice." _Allowing people to choose how to live their lives?  What a great concept.  Of course there's always two sides to the story, and the comments on the boycottmcdonalds site are a fun way to get a feel for the 'other side' in all their outspoken glory...I'll post some snippets below...

  * _ I always thought of McDonalds as a family spot, clean and decent with high values..._

	
  * _ It is too bad that McDonald's is supporting the gay and lesbian movement. I guess you never heard about Sodom and Gomorrah in the bible. Read the book of Genesis as this will give you all the information needed as to what happens to those that support homosexual behavior. God determined to punish them by wiping them out... _

	
  * _ ...I am deeply saddened at your decision to sponsor the sodomitic lifestyle. Thoughts have consequences, which usually lead to actions and it seems that McDonalds has caved to a few sodomites that believe that their choice to have sexual relations with the same sex is on par with other true civil rights..._

	
  * _ As Registerewd Nurses, my wife and I know the 15 to 25 yr. shortened life of homosexuals.We'll pass on anything Micky D's might pass to us... _

	
  * _By doing this McDonalds  sides with those who are out to destroy the concept of normal relationships and replace it with one of perversion is OK. I will not support of do business with those who support perversion_

	
  * _McDonalds has officially become sponsors of perversity not diversity, being black a woman,Indian or Jewish are immutable traits that constitute as diversity, you are sponsoring child molestation, and perverse behavior these vile people have chosen to lead this deathstyle! Over 66% of all molestation are in the sodomite community, staggering considering only 2-3% of the population are queer! God will bring you down for supporting what He call an abomination. Judgement is already on this nation, now you have joined God's list of enemies!" _

	
  * _What an American tragedy..._

	
  * _There is no greater threat to the American family than your action supporting homosexual marriages and the homosexual lifestyle. You were not required to make a statement that directly supported this gross divergence from healthy and appropriate love that families living as they were biologically created for. We are not your Judge but one day you will have to face HIM._

	
  * _ "A mCdONALDS IS SCHEDULED TO BE OPENED BY FALL IN OUR COMMUNITY. I WILL ENSURE EVERYONE LOCALLY IS AWARE OF YOUR SUPPORT OF QUEERS/GAYS/LESBIANS. MY 2 NEICES & TWO NEPHEWS ARE GOING TO BE MADE AWARE THAT THATS WHAT YOU STAND FOR -- THE OVERTHROW OF CHRISTIAN AMERICA.NO MORE MCDONALDS IN OUR ENTIRE FAMILY!!!!!!!!!!!!" _

	
  * _ "SHAME, SHAME, SHAME ON YOU. I AM SORRY THAT YOU'RE FORCING ME AND MY FAMILY TO BOYCOTT MCCONALD'S RESATAURANTS BECAUSE YOU CONTINUE TO "MIND OTHER PEOPLE'S BUSINESS". WHAT GOES ON BEHIND CLOSED DOORS IS "THEIR BUSINESS" AND I HATE THAT YOU'RE PUSHING IT ON ME AND MINE. YOU WILL LEARN THAT WE (THE MAJORITY) ARE NOT INTERSETED IN THE HOMOSEXUAL / LESBIAN / BI-SEXUAL / PORNOGRAPHY AND PEDAFILIA AGENDAS AND WE WILL FIGHT." _

	
  * _You can stuff your Happy Gay  Meal and Happy Gay Agenda where the Sun don't Shine!_


I want to post more, but it just goes on and on.  It's pretty sad that people judge others by what they claim an old book tells them, wait, wouldn't that book say something about judging others?  Oh well, at least it explains why Dubya served two terms; there are some backwards assed people out there.
