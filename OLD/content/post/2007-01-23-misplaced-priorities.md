Damn, file this under pathetic and sad, [Americans spend more time with PC than spouse](http://www.shortnews.com/shownews.cfm?id=59727). "A recent survey conducted by Kelton Research discovered what many spouses have known for years. A startling 65% of people asked to participate spent more time with their household PC than with their own spouse. The survey also found that 52% of those same people said their "most recent experience with a computer problem provoked emotions such as anger, sadness or alienation." Among other things noted in the findings were that a staggering 84% of those surveyed said that they were "more dependent on their home computer now than they were just three years ago."  If this isn't a wake up call to folks to get a life then I suspect psychology will be a booming business in 20-30 years...not to mention divorce court.
