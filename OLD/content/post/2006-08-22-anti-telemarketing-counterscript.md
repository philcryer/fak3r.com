 to turn the tables on the telemarketers. Now all I have to do is get rude enough to run through this with one of them. Sometimes I just pretend I can't hear very well, other times I ask questions while they're talking, etc, but with all the blacklists and auto do-not-call lists, we don't get them anymore. The few we do we tell them that they're not allowed to call, and put us on the do-not-call list, they comply. Still, this is fun, would be nice to make it into a real script, one that would query known spam email servers with all sorts of junk without ever accepting the junk email!
