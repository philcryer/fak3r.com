Getting carded for buying a 6-pack when you're 25 is annoying, but when it happens when you're 38 it's pretty sweet.Â  While it doesn't happen as often as it used to, it's not an isolated incident, so  I *must* be doing something right...either that or I act pretty immature, but even with that, I really think they go on looks, so yeah.
