Ok, so after having my 'original' blog online for four years I start this one, with the idea of staying truer to the blog ideal.  I still love my main site, and will continue to write it, but it has taken a far greater swing towards politics than I had planned.  These things needed to be discussed by me, and I like the way it naturally turned that way, but now it doesn't feel like the right place for me to blab about beer, music, art or geeks stuff; so here we are.  Props to [Seb Payne](http://www.evolutioncolt.com/~spayne/blog/) for the inspriation.
