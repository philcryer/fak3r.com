**UPDATE**: Tickets onsale for Tue 22 ST LOUIS, MO : The Pageant - _10 a.m., March 31._  I'm assuming this is via Ticketmaster, but I'll try to find out ahead of time.  Also, the Austin show goes onsale at the same time.

Just announced, Morrissey is doing a Spring US tour, but for the first time in 16 years, [he's playing Saint Louis](http://true-to-you.net/morrissey_news_070313_01)!   Tuesday, May 22 at [The Pageant](http://www.thepageant.com/), my favorite mid sized venue, holding only about 2000.  I've seen him four times, once in Saint Louis, and three times in Chicago, but it's clearly been too long.  His last minute cancelation (literally the night before) in Austin a few years back was a heartbreaker, but hey, even my peeps down there will get to finally see him at The Backyard.  Awesome.
