<p>It would be hard for me to overemphasize Lou Reed's impact on music history. <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lou-reed-velvet-underground-leader-and-rock-pioneer-dead-at-71-20131027">Rolling Stone</a> has a good overview of his life and all that he accomplished, and while he wrote so many great songs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_Jane">Sweet Jane</a> will stand as one of the greatest rock and roll songs ever written. For now Rolling Stone ranked it #335 on their list of the 500 greatest songs of all time. When I saw him play in 1996 he opened with that and then played a perfect set. RIP Lou, thanks for the music.</p>
