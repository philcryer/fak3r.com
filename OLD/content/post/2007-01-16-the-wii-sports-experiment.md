.  "_Six weeks ago, I began what has become a huge obsession of mine. It is called the “**Wii Sports Experiment**” I outlined a 6 week game plan for myself, the idea being that I would continue ALL normal activity and eating habits, and simply add 30 minutes of Wii Sports to my day. For the past month and a half, I’ve stuck to these guidelines very strictly._"  The condensed version is that **he lost 9 pounds and 2% of his body fat** by playing the games, and he plans to stay on it even though the experiment is over.  This confirms what I have heard from friends who've played Wii; you can get a workout from it.  While I always knew I would someday soon buy a Wii as the step up from our beloved, purple Gamecube, now I have a date, next month for my birthday.  That we can play all the games that I, my wife and the kiddos <strike>like</strike> love <strike></strike>is just gravy as we transition over to the new Wii games.  Who knows, perhaps I'll try out the 6 week plan myself.
