 on vinyl in **1986**. At the time it was only available on vinyl, so I had to go to a friend's house who had his parent's stereo setup with a good turntable so I could tape it, and then play it in my car. Yeah, that's funny, both in how long ago it was, and that I remember all of it.Â  As I've mentioned before, I love music, and even the act of visiting a music store is some religious experince for me, there's no telling what will happen that I'll be retelling some 20 years later...
