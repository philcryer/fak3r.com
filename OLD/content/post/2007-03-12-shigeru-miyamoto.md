, Shigeru Miyamoto serves as the creative force behind the world’s most popular and enduring video games for Nintendo video game hardware systems.  Miyamoto joined Nintendo in 1977 as a staff artist and quickly built a reputation for himself. As the creator of the hugely popular Mario and Zelda games, he is one of the most revered figures in the video game world. In 1981, Nintendo released Miyamoto’s first masterpiece, the arcade game Donkey Kong. In 1985, Nintendo released the Nintendo Entertainment System with Miyamoto’s Super Mario Bros. The classic side-scrolling action game set the standard for all future home console video games. Eventually, more than 40 million units were sold worldwide, and a series of mega-hit titles was born, including the 1996 Nintendo 64 best seller, Super Mario 64. More than 193 million video games in the Super Mario series have been sold worldwide. To date, Miyamoto has worked on more than 100 different Nintendo video game titles. As a producer for Kirby and Pokémon games, he has supported younger video game creators. Miyamoto’s most recent video game projects include Wii Sports, The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, Nintendogs, Super Mario Galaxy and design work on the Wii hardware. He also was responsible for The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, Metroid Prime, Super Mario Sunshine, Pikmin, Luigi’s Mansion and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, which has been called the greatest video game of all time._"  All I have to say is, "Wow" and "Thanks"
