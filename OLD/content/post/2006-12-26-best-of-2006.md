 of my favorite releases of the year, 2006.  It was a great year, again, as I found a lot of new stuff that I will take with me.  Band of Horses came out of nowhere with an incredible cd, if I had to choose one from the year, that could be it. Straight outta France came Birdy Nam Nam, four DJs playing their 1200s as if they were a band, and it works!  Of course old-timers as well, witness Sonic Youth's release, how do they keep doing it?  Oh, and let's hear it for mp3 blogs to help us find our way!  Noise, beautiful noise.
