Blah, here's an [updated list of the now 503(!) bands](http://www.austinist.com/archives/2007/02/05/sxsw_2007_band_list_update_as_the_delay_grows_eternal_we_bring_you_over_500_acts_playing_the_fest.php) scheduled to play this years' [SXSW music festival](http://2007.sxsw.com/music/); and these are just the 'offical' bands, over the years there's been more and more day shows that were mainly free, so you could see a ton more than we used to over the 5 days/nights.  I used to go every year, from 1995 to 2004 - so to miss it for 3 years hurts.  Ah, it was so much fun to go to in the earlier days; venues packed, discovering new bands multiple times a day, shopping at [Waterloo Records](http://www.waterloorecords.com/) with a crowd that made it feel like Christmas in Spring.  It was the trip in 1995 that convinced my girlfriend and I to make the move, and we have never regretted it.  Bah, if anyone hits the [Emo's](http://www.emosaustin.com/) Free Friday afternoon [Pitchfork show](http://assets.pitchforkmedia.com/images/image/25961.SXSWGraphicFinal.jpg), please down a Lone Star tallboy while standing at the outdoor stage in the Texas sun for me....sigh.  One of these years I'll be back!
