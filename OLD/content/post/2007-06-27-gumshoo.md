 is the one to beat.  Billed on their site as, "A simpler, safer, smarter way to shop eBay, Filter out junk, accessories, used items & more, Find misspelled auction bargains, See the seller's 30-day feedback trend, Identify potential auction risks before bidding", it does not disappoint.  The searches feel quicker, and are presently simply, but it really weeds out the junk that you usually get from eBay searches.  The items appear in a column on the left hand side of the browser window, and clicking on any of them causes it to open in the main window.  It takes away most of the annoyances that I've had with eBay as far as trying to find things, and the fact that it covers misspellings automatically is fantastic.
