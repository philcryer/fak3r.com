 current release, _Wincing the Night Away,_ on a much higher level.  It's a fantastic release and displays a perfect cross section of light and dark pop that their earlier releases barely hinted at; it's a great/solid listen.  With critics, including my wife, in almost universal agreement of this releases' merits, many don't see anything better coming out this year.  But of course with this being only October, don't call it the album of the year...yet.
