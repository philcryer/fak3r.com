[![OpenBSD](http://fak3r.com/openbsd_96x96.png)](http://fak3r.com/?attachment_id=3900)

I installed [OpenBSD](http://www.openbsd.org/) 5.1 recently on my new box that's running [Proxmox](http://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Main_Page) 2.1. I want OpenBSD to run [pf](http://www.openbsd.org/faq/pf/) to provide a firewall to protect all the other virtualized hosts on the box. I don't remember what I put for my default route during the install, and that came back to bite me as I couldn't get outside of my network. Issuing a ping would resolve a hostname (I run a local DNS server) but then it didn't have a route to the resolved IP, so it would fail with the error `ping: sendto: No route to host`

    
    # ping www.google.com
    PING www.l.google.com (74.125.225.208): 56 data bytes
    ping: sendto: No route to host
    ping: wrote www.l.google.com 64 chars, ret=-1
    ping: sendto: No route to host
    ping: wrote www.l.google.com 64 chars, ret=-1

It took a bit of digging online, but in the end it was a simple fix; delete the default route and re-add it (I put in my gateway's IP)

    
    route delete default
    route add default 192.168.1.1


Now everything works as it should.

    
    # ping www.google.com

Of course use a different IP if your gateway is different, but after that you'll be like me; all ready to setup pf on the network!
