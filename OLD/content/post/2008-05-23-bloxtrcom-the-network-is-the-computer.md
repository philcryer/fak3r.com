## [Don’t have a laptop? Try the virtual computer!](http://objsam.wordpress.com/2008/05/07/dont-have-a-laptop-try-the-virtual-computer/)

K. Ansar and P.P. Ismail, final year computer science students at an engineering college in Kerala India, have set up [www.bloxtr.com](http://www.bloxtr.com/), the prototype of a virtual computer in which you can store all your important documents, favorite music, colorful pictures and even videos.

The idea is that no one needs to carry a laptop or pen drive around. You can upload any files to the website and access it from any corner of the world. What you need is just an interface to access the internet.

According to the creators, bloxtr is just a project and they are hoping for investment by corporate firms for the further development of their prototype.
