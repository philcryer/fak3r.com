**UPDATE**: eek! That page has gone away, but never fear, the Shockwave file is still out there to enjoy, just do a [Google search for smb_super_synth.swf](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=smb_super_synth.swf&btnG=Google+Search).  I found it [here](http://shingaku-jump.skr.jp/j08/data/smb_super_synth.swf), [here](http://mirell.org/swf/smb_super_synth.swf) and [here](http://www.masamune.se/tippen4ever/smb_super_synth.swf).

Someone has made a Flash page where you can replay all the audio from the NES (Nintendo 8-bit console) game, [Super Mario Brothers](http://redruth.greenbean.org/~ben/4CR/smb_super_synth.swf)!  So fun, those sounds, especially the background music, is just burned into my brain.  Funny, just this week I converted a Super Mario sound theme from Adium (available for download [here](http://www.adiumxtras.com/index.php?a=xtras&xtra_id=382)) to work with Gaim!  It’s a ton of fun.  Here’s hoping that the Nintendo Revolution will allow us to download and play the original classics like this, as [others are claiming](http://www.gamegossip.com/comment.php?id=13385) that it will do just that.
