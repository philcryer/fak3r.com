 but I've never read so much about Gravel, he's pretty damn impressive too. With all the candidates jockeying for position on the seemingly 100s of debates, it's nice to have a resource to get some facts. There's no third party candidates thought, but hey, it's far more than what most American's will know about the stances of the candidates on the issues.  Everyone should register to vote, then become educated about things; if you don't you can't complain.
