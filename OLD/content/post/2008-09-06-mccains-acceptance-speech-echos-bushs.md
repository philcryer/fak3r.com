This is glorious, The Daily Show obliterates McCain's acceptance speech by interspersing clips of Dubya's acceptance speech.  It's funny that much of it is the same - WORD FOR WORD!  So I guess that's the change they keep talking about.  Damn McCain, you crazy [Mavrick](http://mavrick2008.blogspot.com/)! (sic)
