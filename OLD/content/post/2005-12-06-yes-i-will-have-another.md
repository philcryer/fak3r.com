I'm always seeing reports that basically state the same thing; moderate drinking is good for you, but now we also learn that it can [may lower risk of becoming obese](http://www.healthday.com/view.cfm?id=529465)!  So while past reports have touted decreased chance of heart disease and high blood pressure, today's report states that, "_...new research suggests it may also help you stay svelte.  Regular drinkers who consume one or two drinks a few times a week are less likely to be obese compared with people who do not drink_" with the obvious disclaimer, "_However, having four or more drinks per day increases the risk of being obese by 46 percent, researchers report_."  So there's another reason that it's not only OK, but perhaps benificial in many ways for you to have a few beers at night after a (boring) day at work.  So in the words of James Rohrer, from the department of family medicine at the Mayo Clinic, "_Moderation is the best policy," he says. "**Moderate drinking is probably a reasonably healthy behavior. We cannot show any benefits from the complete abstention from alcohol**_."  Bottoms up.
