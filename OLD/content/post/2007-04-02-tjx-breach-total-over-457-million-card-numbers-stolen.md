covers the ongoing *how did this happen* question. "_TJMaxx computer system intruders who stole 45.7 million credit cards. **The **__**worm operated **__**undetected for at least 18 months**, capturing credit card numbers, then __changing timelogs and moving data around to erase its tracks. Initial speculation suggested that the thieves had access to the retailer's encryption __key. Now **it may be that the program captured data before it was encrypted. If the latter**, the ramifications are immense, as** it means every single retailer's credit card processing system is at risk**._"
