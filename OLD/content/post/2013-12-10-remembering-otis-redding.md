Today a random tweet directed me to this post, <a href="http://www.chimesfreedom.com/2013/12/09/otis-reddings-tragic-plane-crash-in-wisconsin/">Otis Reddingâ€™s Tragic Plane Crash in Wisconsin</a>, reminding me that Otis Redding died on this day in 1967 at the age of 26. His songs and songwriting are some of the best I've ever heard. We're big fans of his music at home and also have some video performance of his from the DVD <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Otis-Redding-Remembering/dp/6304937261/">Otis Redding: Remembering Otis</a>. Here's the video on Youtube.
