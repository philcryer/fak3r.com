, Futurama *really* is coming back, with the same cast to boot!  "_Futurama" star Katey Sagal confirmed the return of the show on Comedy Central Tuesday night during an appearance on Craig Ferguson's "Late L__ate Show. ...  The quirky animated show from "Simpsons" creator Matt Groening was canceled by Fox about two years ago, but will return with at least 13 new episodes on Comedy Central by 2008. This is only the second time in television history that a show sent to TV's trash heap has been resurrected. Curiously, the first was "Family Guy," also an animated Fox show. The tale of "Futurama's" dramatic revival roughly follows that same path that "Family Guy" did. In both cases, the shows have been successfully airing on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim late-night programming block. They both also turned into hot-selling DVD box sets. "Family Guy" returned to Fox earlier this year, while last fall, Comedy Central outbid Adult Swim for the license to air all 52 episodes of "Futurama" and whatever new episodes might one day be produced. This week, deals were inked to secure all of the original voice talent and the production staff of "Futurama," paving the way for the series' return to TV_."  Hmmm...but it's not until 2008, to quote Fry, "_That's not soon enough_."  Or, as Professor Fansworth would say, "_Sweet Zombie Jesus!_"
