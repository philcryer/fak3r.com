 to go to Speakeasy.


You can [check for availability](https://www.speakeasy.net/home/qual/) to see if you can get Speakeasy where you live, [take a look at their nationwide network](http://www.speakeasy.net/network/networkmap.php), see near realtime (updated every 15 minutes) pings that give the latency between each of their POPs or [test the speed](http://www.speakeasy.net/speedtest/) of your current connection.  Recently we've cut over to their [VoIP service](http://www.speakeasy.net/home/voip/) for our home phones, and at the same time switched to their 'one link' service which cuts SBC/ATT out of the loop completely.  My signal goes from my house to Speakeasy hardware, so to be able to bypass the monopoly that I had to put up with for so many years feels great.
