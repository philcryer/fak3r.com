.  While The New Pornographers style is straight up, fun, power-pop, Neko's solo work is steeped more in bittersweet country and gospel, however she seems to combine both on her solo shows, which I have not experienced in person.  Her prior release to 'Flood', was the strong live effort, The Tigers Have Spoken.  TNP are a different story, I've seen them twice and they're even more fun in person than they releases hint at; highly recommended.  Give her a listen.
