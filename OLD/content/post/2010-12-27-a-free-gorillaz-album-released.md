Over** **the weekend,** GORILLAZ JUST POSTED** their new album _The Fall_, which was mixed and recorded using Damon Albarn's Apple iPad during their recent US tour, for free. You can currently stream it (for the price of your email address) on [thefall.gorillaz.com](http://thefall.gorillaz.com/) - or download it from file-sharing sites, linked to by good chaps such as [2dopeboyz.com](http://www.2dopeboyz.com/2010/12/26/gorillaz-the-fall-free-album). Additionally, a physical release of the album is planned for 2011, bringing to mind the first large scale attempt at this when [Radiohead released _In Rainbows_](http://fak3r.com/2007/10/02/radiohead-groundbreaking-release-in-rainbows-eminent/). If this is a trend I fully support it, and think it's (one way that) music will be (successfully) distributed in the future.
