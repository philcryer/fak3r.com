I've been going back and forth with the "Boys and Girls in America" by [The Hold Steady](http://www.theholdsteady.com/), listened to the standout single, and streamed the full CD...it's got some really good tunes, but I'm not sure if it's going to get the nod at the local rekerd store or not.  Feel free to give your feedback after some listens, it shouldn't hurt.

Give a listen to 'Chips Ahoy':
[audio:http://downloads.pitchforkmedia.com/Hold%20Steady%20-%20Chips%20Ahoy.mp3]

Then you can listen to an acoustic version of the album opener, 'Stuck between stations'

After that stream their the album at their '[listening party](http://www.vagrant.com/holdsteady_listeningparty/)' page, you can see the video for [Chips Ahoy](http://www.spinner.com/2006/10/17/video-premiere-the-hold-steady-chips-ahoy?ncid=AOLMUS00050000000039), you can checkout their stupid [myspace page](http://www.myspace.com/theholdsteady) (thanks Caroline, but I've got this one), and hell, I'm sure you could do worse.
