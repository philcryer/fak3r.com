The British comedy [Red Dwarf](http://www.reddwarf.co.uk) has been a favorite of mine for many years, and this year it celebrates its 20th year anniversary.  While they show hasn't *constantly* been in production this fact is a bit misleading, but regardless, this year the crew of The Cat, Rimmer, Lister and Kryten are reuniting for a new 3 part series, _Back To Earth_.<!-- more --> Their previous adventures cover all sorts of ground, but basically there's a skeleton crew left in a mining ship lost far out in space.  I've been in the loop on the new episodes since I'm following [Robert Llewellyn](http://twitter.com/bobbyllew) on Twitter, he plays Kryten, the android on the right in the picture.  It's been really interesting learning about the man behind the character as he goes about his day, with a lot of his efforts focused on Car Pool, an interview show he produces where he interviews celebrates while car pooling in his Prius.  Really funny stuff.  As a bonus, a few weeks back he had Chis Barrie, who plays Lister in Red Dwarf, as seen standing next to Kryten above.  It's a funny interview, file those two under guys I'd like to have some beers with.  You can find the show on Robert's own site, [Llewtube](http://www.llewtube.com/) or download them as podcasts over at iTunes.  For the uninitiated who are interested in Red Dwarf, the best way to start is at the end, and by the end I mean the pilot for the show entitled [_The End_](http://youtube.com/watch?v=jrnw243CCE4).  The shows are all on DVD and hilarious, and next to AbFab I can't think of a British Sitcom that I enjoy more.
