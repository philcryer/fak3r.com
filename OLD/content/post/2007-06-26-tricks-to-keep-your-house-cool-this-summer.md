Some oft repeated ideas, but worth mentioning, [tricks to keep your house cool this Summer](http://freshome.com/2007/06/25/tricks-keep-your-house-cool-this-summer/).  Some new ideas that I hadn't thought of like, "plant trees or shrubs to shade air conditioning units" I will look into doing this weekend.  There's always more you can do, but while I'm not going to paint my roof white, covering it with solar panels would be even better; provide shade for the roof, while taking the brunt of the energy out of the sun and putting it to good use.
