If you like Flash or not, it's still a pain to surf without it since is so widely used (not always for the best; record companies, I'm looking at you), so it's great that [Adobe has released Flash Player 9 for Linux](http://www.adobe.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/9/releasenotes.html).  They have a [blog about their Linux development](http://blogs.adobe.com/penguin.swf/), and some nice [wiki style docs](http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Flash_Player:Additional_Interface_Support_for_Linux) as well.  After Flash 7 they didn't work on a Linux port, causing quite the worry in the Linux desktop arena, but their renewed investment only bodes well for more widespread use of Linux as a desktop (which 0wns all other workstations IMO).
