### The honorable mentions

<p>There was a ton of great music that came out this year, many of these I liked but for whatever reason they didn't catch fire as much as the ones above. I list them here for both of our benefit, since I may move some of these up as time goes on. Give em a go, maybe you'll dig them more than I did.</p>

* Shame "Songs of Praise"
* Sleaford Mods "English Tapas"
* Sleep "The Sciences"
* Soccer Mommy "Clean"
* Colter Wall "Songs of the Plains"
* Thom Yorke "Suspiria"

## The shows

<p>Seeing bands live is still one of my favorite things, and wow, this old guy got out to see 25 of them again this year. Didn't plan to match last year's total, but here we are. If I had to pick the best of the year it'd have to be the Jeff Rosenstock show at Off Broadway, which was just such a fun show. Right behind him though is Hot Snakes, which put on an inspired set of noise for faithful. The list of all the shows...</p>

<p>Jonathan Richman w/Tommy Larkin (in Austin, at the Mohawk), Ought with Snail Mail, Hot Snakes, Matt and Kim with Cruisr, Coast Modern, Willie Nelson and Family, The Decemberists, Jeff Rosenstock, U2, Spoon, Vance Joy with Alice Merton, Dropkick Murphies with Flogging Molly, Guided by Voices, Sloan, TWRP with Planet Booty, Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit, Screaming Females with Kitten Forever, Swinging Utters, The English Beat, The Alarm, Cloud Nothings with Nap Eyes, Smoking Popes, Starwolf, Amanda Shires, and Thom Yorke.</p>
